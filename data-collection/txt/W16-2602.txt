Abstract

Metadata extraction is known to be a
problem in general-purpose Web corpora,
and so is extensive crawling with little
yield. The contributions of this paper are
threefold: a method to find and download
large numbers of WordPress pages; a tar-
geted extraction of content featuring much
needed metadata; and an analysis of the
documents in the corpus with insights of
actual blog uses.

The study focuses on a publishing soft-
ware (WordPress), which allows for reli-
able extraction of structural elements such
as metadata, posts, and comments. The
download of about 9 million documents in
the course of two experiments leads after
processing to 2.7 billion tokens with us-
able metadata. This comparatively high
yield is a step towards more efficiency
with respect to machine power and “Hi-Fi”
web corpora.

The resulting corpus complies with formal
requirements on metadata-enhanced cor-
pora and on weblogs considered as a series
of dated entries. However, existing typolo-
gies on Web texts have to be revised in the
light of this hybrid genre.

1 Introduction

1.1 Context

This article introduces work on focused web cor-
pus construction with linguistic research in mind.
The purpose of focused web corpora is to comple-
ment existing collections, as they allow for better
coverage of specific written text types and genres,
user-generated content, as well as latest language

evolutions. However, it is quite rare to find ready-
made resources. Specific issues include first the
discovery of relevant web documents, and second
the extraction of text and metadata, e.g. because
of exotic markup and text genres (Schäfer et al.,
2013). Nonetheless, proper extraction is neces-
sary for the corpora to be established as scientific
objects, as science needs an agreed scheme for
identifying and registering research data (Samp-
son, 2000). Web corpus yield is another recurrent
problem (Suchomel and Pomikálek, 2012; Schäfer
et al., 2014). The shift from web as corpus to
web for corpus – mostly due to an expanding Web
universe and the need for better text quality (Vers-
ley and Panchenko, 2012) – as well as the limited
resources of research institutions make extensive
downloads costly and prompt for handy solutions
(Barbaresi, 2015).

The DWDS lexicography project1 at the Berlin-
Brandenburg Academy of Sciences already fea-
tures a good coverage of specific written text gen-
res (Geyken, 2007). Further experiments includ-
ing internet-based text genres are currently con-
ducted in joint work with the Austrian Academy
of Sciences (Academy Corpora). The common ab-
sence of metadata known to the philological tradi-
tion such as authorship and publication date ac-
counts for a certain defiance regarding Web re-
sources, as linguistic evidence cannot be cited or
identified properly in the sense of the tradition.
Thus, missing or erroneous metadata in “one size
fits all” web corpora may undermine the relevance
of web texts for linguistic purposes and in the hu-
manities in general. Additionally, nearly all ex-
isting text extraction and classification techniques
have been developed in the field of information
retrieval, that is not with linguistic objectives in
mind.

The contributions of this paper are threefold:
(1) a method to find and download large amounts
of WordPress pages;
(2) a targeted extraction of content featuring much
needed metadata;
(3) an analysis of the documents in the corpus with
insights of actual uses of the blog genre.
My study focuses on a publishing software with
two experiments, first on the official platform
wordpress.com and second on the .at-domain.
WordPress is used by about a quarter of the web-
sites worldwide2, the software has become so
broadly used that its current deployments can be
expected to differ from the original ones. A
number of 158,719 blogs in German have pre-
viously been found on wordpress.com (Barbaresi
and Würzner, 2014). The .at-domain (Austria)
is in quantitative terms the 32th top-level domain
with about 3,7 million hosts reported.3

1.2 Definitional and typological criteria
From the beginning of research on blogs/weblogs,
the main definitional criterion has always been
their form, a “reverse chronological sequences of
dated entries” (Kumar et al., 2003). Another for-
mal criterion is the use of dedicated software to ar-
ticulate and publish the entries, a “weblog publish-
ing software tool” (Glance et al., 2004), “public-
domain blog software” (Kumar et al., 2003), or
Content Management System (CMS). These tools
largely impact the way blogs are created and run.
1996 seems to be the acknowledged beginning of
the blog/weblog genre, with an exponential in-
crease of their use starting in 1999 with the emer-
gence of several user-friendly publishing tools
(Kumar et al., 2003; Herring et al., 2004).

Whether a blog is to be considered to be a web
page in its whole (Glance et al., 2004) or a website
containing a series of dated entries, or posts, (Ke-
hoe and Gee, 2012) being each a web page, there
are invariant elements, such as “a persistent side-
bar containing profile information” as well as links
to other blogs (Kumar et al., 2003), or blogroll.
For that matter, blogs are intricately intertwined in
what has been called the blogosphere: “The cross-
linking that takes place between blogs, through
blogrolls, explicit linking, trackbacks, and refer-
rals has helped create a strong sense of community
in the weblogging world.” (Glance et al., 2004).

wordpress/all/all

This means that a comprehensive crawl could lead
to better yields.

Regarding the classification of blogs, Blood
(2002) distinguishes three basic types: filters, per-
sonal journals, and notebooks, while Krishna-
murthy (2002) builds a typology based on func-
tion and intention of the blogs: online diaries, sup-
port group, enhanced column, collaborative con-
tent creation. More comprehensive typologies es-
tablished on one hand several genres: online jour-
nal, self-declared expert, news filter, writer/artist,
spam/advertisement; and on the other hand dis-
tinctive “variations”: collaborative writing, com-
ments from readers, means of publishing (Glance
et al., 2004).

2.1 (Meta-)Data Extraction

Data extraction has first been based on “wrappers”
(nowadays: “scrapers”) which were mostly rely-
ing on manual design and tended to be brittle and
hard to maintain (Crescenzi et al., 2001). These
extraction procedures have also been used early
on by blogs search engines (Glance et al., 2004).
Since the genre of “web diaries” was established
before the blogs in Japan, there have been attempts
to target not only blog software but also regular
pages (Nanno et al., 2004), in which the extraction
of metadata also allows for a distinction based on
heuristics.

Efforts were made to generate wrappers auto-
matically, with emphasis on three different ap-
proaches (Guo et al., 2010): wrapper induction
(e.g. by building a grammar to parse a web page),
sequence labeling (e.g. labeled examples or a
schema of data in the page), and statistical anal-
ysis and series of resulting heuristics. This analy-
sis combined to the inspection of DOM tree char-
acteristics (Wang et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2010)
is a common ground to the information retrieval
and web corpus linguistics communities, with the
categorization of HTML elements and linguistic
features (Ziegler and Skubacz, 2007) for the for-
mer, and markup and boilerplate removal opera-
tions known to the latter community (Schäfer and
Bildhauer, 2013).

Regarding content-based wrappers for blogs in
particular, targets include the title of the entry, the
date, the author, the content, the number of com-
ments, the archived link, and the trackback link
(Glance et al., 2004); they can also aim at com-

8



ments specifically (Mishne and Glance, 2006).

2.2 Blog corpus construction
The first and foremost issue in blog corpus con-
struction still holds true today: “there is no com-
prehensive directory of weblogs, although several
small directories exist” (Glance et al., 2004). Pre-
vious work established several modes of construc-
tion, from broad, opportunistic approaches, to the
focus on a particular method or platform due to the
convenience of retrieval processes. Corpus size
and length of downloads are frequently mentioned
as potential obstacles. Glance et al. (2004) per-
formed URL harvesting through specialized direc-
tories, and found a practical upper bound at about
100,000 active weblogs, which were used as a cor-
pus in their study.

The first comprehensive studies used feeds to
collect blog texts (Gruhl et al., 2004), since they
are a convenient way to bypass extensive crawling
and to harvest blog posts (and more rarely com-
ments) without needing any boilerplate removal.

An approach based on RSS and Atom feeds
is featured in the TREC-Blog collection4 (Mac-
donald and Ounis, 2006), a reference in Informa-
tion Extraction which has been used in a num-
ber of evaluation tasks. 100,649 blogs were pre-
determined, they are top blogs in terms of popu-
larity, but no further information is given. Spam
blogs, and hand-picked relevant blogs (no infor-
mation on the criteria either) are used to comple-
ment and to balance the corpus to make it more
versatile. The corpus is built by fetching feeds
describing recent postings, whose permalinks are
used as a reference. From initial figures totaling
3,215,171 permalinks and 324,880 homepages,
most recent ones from 2008 mention 1,303,520
feeds and 28,488,766 permalink documents.5

Another way to enhance the quality of data and
the ease of retrieval is the focus on a particular
platform. To study authorship attribution, Schler
et al. (2006) gathered a total of 71,000 blogs on the
Google-owned Blogger platform, which allowed
for easier extraction of content, although no com-
ments are included in the corpus.

The Birmingham Blog Corpus (Kehoe and Gee,
2012) is a more recent approach to comprehen-
sive corpus construction. Two platforms are taken
into consideration: Blogger and wordpress.com,

5https://web.archive.org/web/20160313020503/

http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/test collections/blogs08info.html

with the “freshly pressed” page on WordPress as
well as a series of trending blogs used as seed
for the crawls, leading to 222,245 blog posts and
2,253,855 comments from Blogger and WordPress
combined, totaling about 95 million tokens (for
the posts) and 86 million tokens (for the com-
ments).

The YACIS Corpus (Ptaszynski et al., 2012) is
a Japanese corpus consisting of blogs collected
from a single blog platform, which features mostly
users in the target language as well as a clear
HTML structure. Its creators were able to gather
about 13 million webpages from 60,000 bloggers
for a total of 5.6 billion tokens.

Last, focused crawl on the German version of
the platform wordpress.com led to the construc-
tion of a corpus of 100 million tokens under Cre-
ative Commons licenses (Barbaresi and Würzner,
2014), albeit with a much lower proportion of
comments (present on 12.7% of the posts). In fact,
comments have been shown to be strongly related
to the popularity of a blog (Mishne and Glance,
2006), so that the number of comments is much
lower when blogs are taken at random.

The sharp decrease in publication of work doc-
umenting blog corpus construction after 2008 sig-
nalizes a shift of focus, not only because web
corpus construction does not often get the atten-
tion it deserves, but also because of the growing
popularity of short message services like Twitter,
which allow for comprehensive studies on social
networks and internet-based communication, with
a larger number of users and messages as well as
clear data on network range (e.g. followers).

3 Method

3.1 Discovery

A detection phase is needed to be able to observe
bloggers “in the wild” without needing to resort to
large-scale crawling. In fact, guessing if a web-
site uses WordPress by analyzing HTML code is
straightforward if nothing was been done to hide
it, which is almost always the case. However,
downloading even a reasonable number of web
pages may take a lot of time. That is why I chose
to perform massive scans in order to find websites
using WordPress, which to my best knowledge has
not yet been tried in the literature. The detection
process is twofold, the first filter is URL-based
whereas the final selection uses shallow HTTP re-
quests.

9



The permalinks settings6 in WordPress define
five common URL structures: default (?p= or
?page id= or ?paged=), date (/year/ and/or /month/
and/or /day/ and so on), post number (/key-
word/number – where keyword is for example
“archives”), tag or category (/tag/, /category/, or
cross-language equivalents), and finally post name
(long URLs containing a lot of hyphens). Patterns
derived from those structures can serve as a first
filter, although the patterns are not always reliable:
news websites tend to use dates very frequently in
URLs, in that case the accuracy of the prediction
is poor.

The most accurate method would be a scan
of fully-rendered HTML documents with clear
heuristics such as the “generator” meta tag in the
header, which by default points to WordPress.
In this study, HTTP HEAD7 requests are used
to spare bandwidth and get cleaner, faster re-
sults. HEAD requests are part of the HTTP pro-
tocol. Like the most frequent request, GET, which
fetches the content, they are supposed to be im-
plemented by every web server. A HEAD re-
quest fetches the meta-information written in re-
sponse headers without downloading the actual
content, which makes it much faster, but also more
resource-friendly, as according to my method less
than three requests per domain name are sufficient.

The following rules come from from the official
documentation and have been field-tested:
(1) A request sent to the homepage is bound to
yield pingback information to use via the XML-
RPC protocol in the X-Pingback header. Note that
if there is a redirect, this header usually points
to the “real” domain name and/or path, ending in
xmlrpc.php. What is more, frequently used Word-
Press modules may leave a trace in the header
as well, e.g. WP-Super-Cache, which identifies a
WordPress-run website with certainty.
(2) A request sent to /login or /wp-login.php
should yield a HTTP status corresponding to an
existing page (2XX, 3XX, more rarely 401).
(3) A request sent to /feed or /wp-feed.php should
yield the header Location.

The criteria can be used separately or in com-
bination. I chose to use a simple decision tree.
The information provided is rarely tampered on
or misleading, since almost all WordPress instal-
lations stick to the defaults. Sending more than

6http://codex.wordpress.org/Using Permalinks
7http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616

one request makes the guess more precise, it also
acts like a redirection check which provides the ef-
fectively used domain name behind a URL. Thus,
since the requests help deduplicating a URL list,
they are doubly valuable.

3.2 Sources and crawls

This study falls doubly into the category of fo-
cused or scoped crawling (Olston and Najork,
2010): the emphasis lies on German or on the .at-
domain, and a certain type of websites are exam-
ined based on structural characteristics.

I have previously shown that the diversity of
sources has a positive impact on yield and quality
(Barbaresi, 2014). Aside from URL lists from this
and other previous experiments (Barbaresi, 2013)
and URLs extracted from each batch of down-
loaded web documents (proper crawls), several
sources were queried, not in the orthodox BootCat
way with randomized tuples (Baroni and Bernar-
dini, 2004) but based on formal URL characteris-
tics as described above:
(1) URLs from the CommonCrawl8, a repository
already used in web corpus construction (Haber-
nal et al., 2016; Schäfer, 2016);
(2) the CDX index query frontend of the internet
Archive;9

(3) public instances of the metasearch engine
Searx.10

A further restriction resides in the downloads
of sitemaps for document retrieval. A majority of
websites are optimized in this respect, and exper-
iments showed that crawls otherwise depend on
unclear directory structures such as posts classi-
fied by categories or month, as well as on variables
(e.g. page) in URL structures, which leads to nu-
merous duplicates and an inefficient crawl. An-
other advantage is that websites offering sitemaps
are almost systematically robot-friendly, which
solves ethical robots.txt-related issues such as the
crawl delay, which is frequently mentioned as an
obstacle in the literature.

3.3 Extraction

I designed a text extraction targeting specifically
WordPress pages, which is transferable to a whole
range of self-hosted websites using WordPress, al-
lowing to reach various blogger profiles thanks

tree/master/wayback-cdx-server

to a comparable if not identical content struc-
ture. The extractor acts like a state-of-the-art
wrapper: after parsing the HTML page, XPATH-
expressions select subtrees and operate on them
through pruning and tag conversion to (1) write
the data with the desired amount of markup and
(2) convert the desired HTML tags into the output
XML format in strict compliance to the guidelines
of the Text Encoding Initiative11, in order to allow
for a greater interoperability within the research
community.

The extraction of metadata targets the following
fields, if available: title of post, title of blog, date
of publication, canonical URL, author, categories,
and tags. The multiple plugins cause strong diver-
gences in the rendered HTML code, additionally
not all websites use all the fields at their disposal.
Thus, titles and canonical URL are the most often
extracted data, followed by date, categories, tags,
and author.

Content extraction allows for a distinction be-
tween post and comments, the latter being listed
as a series of paragraphs with text formatting. The
main difference with extractors used in informa-
tion retrieval is that structural boundaries are kept
(titles, paragraphs), whereas links are discarded
for corpus use. A special attention is given to
dates. Documents with non-existent or missed
date or entry content are discarded during process-
ing and are not part of the corpus, which through
the dated entries is a corpus of “blogs” in a for-
mal sense. Removal of duplicates is performed on
entry basis.

3.4 Content analysis

In the first experiment, language detection is per-
formed with langid.py (Lui and Baldwin, 2012)
and sources are evaluated using the Filtering
and Language identification for URL Crawling
Seeds12 toolchain (Barbaresi, 2014), which in-
cludes obvious spam and non-text documents fil-
tering, redirection checks, collection of host- and
markup-based data, HTML code stripping, docu-
ment validity check, and language identification.
No language detection is undertaken is the sec-
ond experiment since no such filtering is intended.
That being said, a large majority of webpages are
expected to be in German, as has been shown for
another German-speaking country in the .de-TLD

11http://www.tei-c.org/
12https://github.com/adbar/flux-toolchain

(Schäfer et al., 2013).
The token counts below are produced by the

WASTE tokenizer (Jurish and Würzner, 2013).

4 Experiment 1: Retrieving German
blogs

4.1 General figures on harvested content
In a previous experiment, the largest platform
for WordPress-hosted websites, wordpress.com,
blogs under CC license were targeted (Barbaresi
and Würzner, 2014). In the summer of 2015,
sitemaps were retrieved for all known home pages,
which lead to the integral download of 145,507
different websites for a total number of 6,605,078
documents (390 Gb), leaving 6,095,630 files after
processing (36 Gb). There are 6,024,187 “valid”
files (with usable date and content) from 141,648
websites, whose text amounts to about 2.11 billion
tokens.

The distribution of harvested documents in the
course of years is documented in table 6, there
are 6,095,206 documents with at least a reliable
indication of publication year, i.e. 92.3% of all
documents. Contrarily to dates in the literature,
these results are not from reported permalinks
dates from feeds, but directly from page metadata;
nonetheless, there is also a fair share of implausi-
ble dates, comparable to the 3% of the TREC blog
corpus (Macdonald and Ounis, 2006). This indi-
cates that these dates are not an extraction problem
but rather a creative license on the side of the au-
thors.

There are 2,312,843 pages with tags,

ferent tags, the top-15 results are displayed in
table 4. They are as general as the top categories
but slightly more informative.

All in all, the observed metadata are in line
with the expectations, even if the high propor-
tion of photoblogs is not ideal for text collec-
tion. Comments were extracted for 1,454,752
files (24%), this proportion confirms the hypothe-
sis that the wordpress.com-platform leads primar-
ily to the publication of blogs in a traditional fash-
ion. On the contrary, the typology has to be more
detailed in the second experiment due to the ab-
sence of previous knowledge about the collection.

.at-domain

5.1 General figures on harvested content

The iterations summed up in table 5 took place
during the 2nd half of 2015. Each time, all links
in the .at top level domain were extracted, and
analyzed as to their potential to be using Word-
Press. If so, potential sitemaps were retrieved and
the URLs added to the queue if they were new.
When necessary (e.g. after stages 5 and 6), the
crawls have been refreshed with new material de-
scribed in sources. After 11 iterations, seed ex-
haustion was nearing as new WordPress websites
with sitemaps were hard to come by, and the ex-
periment was stopped.

iment

A total of 3,053,974 different URLs have been
downloaded (159 Gb), which left after process-
ing and canonicalization 2,589,674 files (14 Gb).
There are about 2 million “valid” files (with usable
date and content), whose text amounts to about
550 million tokens. There are 5,664 different do-
main names before processing, and 7,275 after
(due to the resolution of canonical URLs).

5.2 Typology

Of all canonical domain names, only 240 con-
tain the word blog. Comments were extracted for
181,246 files (7%), which is explained mainly by
the actual absence of comments and partly by dif-
ficulty of extraction in the case of third-party com-
ment systems.

The distribution of harvested documents in the
course of years is documented in table 6. There are
2,083,535 documents with at least a reliable indi-
cation of publication year, i.e. 80.5% of all docu-
ments. The relative amount of “creative” dates is
slightly higher than in experiment 1, which hints
at a larger diversity of form and content.

The increase in the number of documents ex-
ceeds by far the increase of domains registered in
the .at-TLD13, which seems to hint at the grow-
ing popularity of WordPress and maybe also at the
ephemeral character of blogs.

Table 6: Distribution of documents among plausi-
ble years in the second experiment

An analysis of the top-50 domains names in
canonical URLs extracted from the documents,
by total number of documents in the corpus
(see table 7) gives the following typology: in-
formational for general news websites (9), pro-
motional/commercial for websites which list ads,
deals, jobs or products (12), specialized for fo-
cused news and community websites (16), enter-
tainment (3), political (3), personal for websites
dedicated to a person or an organization (3), adult
(2), forum (1).

There are 260,468 pages with categories,
834,284 uses and 11,813 different categories in to-
tal, the top-15 results are displayed in table 8. The

queue in the second experiment

fact that “blog” is used as a category shows that it
is not taken for granted.

There are 279,083 pages with tags, 5,093,088
uses in total, and 192,352 different tags, the top-
15 results are displayed in table 9. The tags re-
flect a number of different preoccupations, includ-
ing family, holidays, sex, job and labor legislation.
“Homemade” and “amateur” can be used in Ger-
man, albeit rarely, these words give more insights
on the genre (most probably adult entertainment)

6 Discussion

Although the definition of blogs as a hybrid genre
neither fundamentally new nor unique (Herring et
al., 2004) holds true, several assumptions about
weblogs cannot be considered to be accurate any-
more in the light of frequencies in the corpus.
Blogs are not always “authored by a single in-
dividual” (Kumar et al., 2003), nor does the fre-
quency criterion given by the Oxford English Dic-
tionary (Kehoe and Gee, 2012) – “frequently up-
dated web site” – necessarily correspond to the
reality. Even if both experiments gathered blogs
in a formal sense, there are differences between
the websites on the platform wordpress.com and
freely hosted websites. The former are cleaner in

form and content, they are in line with a certain
tradition. The “local community interactions be-
tween a small number of bloggers” (Kumar et al.,
2003) of the beginnings have been relegated by
websites corresponding to the original criteria of
a blog but whose finality is to sell information, en-
tertainment, or concrete products and services.

Consequently, the expectation that “blog soft-
ware makes Web pages truly interactive, even if
that interactive potential has yet to be fully ex-
ploited” (Herring et al., 2004) is either outdated
or yet to come. Beside these transformations
and the emergence of other social networks, the
whole range from top to barely known websites
shows that the number of comments per post and
per website is largely inferior to the “bursting”
phase of webblogging, where comments were “a
substantial part of the blogosphere” (Mishne and
Glance, 2006). The evolution of the Web as well
as the scope of this study cast the typical profile of
a passive internet consumer, a “prosumer” at best,
which should be taken in consideration in web cor-
pus construction and computer-mediated commu-
nication studies. If blogs still bridge a techno-
logical gap between HTML-enhanced CMC and
CMC-enhanced Web pages (Herring et al., 2004),
a typological gap exists between original and cur-
rent studies as well as between users of a platform
and users of a content management system.

7 Conclusion

The trade-off to gain metadata using focused
downloads following strict rules seems to get
enough traction to build larger web corpora, since
a total of 550 Gb of actually downloaded mate-
rial allows after processing for the construction
of a corpus of about 2.7 billion tokens with rich
metadata. This comparatively high yield is a step
towards more efficiency with respect to machine
power and “Hi-Fi” web corpora, which could help
promoting the cause of web sources and modern-
ization of research methodology.

The resulting corpus complies with formal re-
quirements on metadata-enhanced corpora and on
weblogs considered as a series of dated entries.
The interlinking of blogs and their rising popular-
ity certainly don’t stay in the way. However, ad-
dressing the tricky question of web genres seems
inevitable in order to be able to properly qualify
my findings and subsequent linguistic inquiries.
More than ever, blogs are a hybrid genre, and their

14



ecology tends to mimic existing text types, audi-
ences, and motivations, with a focus on informa-
tion (general, specialized, or community-based) as
well as on promotional goals.
