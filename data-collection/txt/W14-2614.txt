Abstract

We provide a simple but novel supervised
weighting scheme for adjusting term fre-
quency in tf-idf for sentiment analysis
and text classification. We compare our
method to baseline weighting schemes and
find that it outperforms them on multiple
benchmarks. The method is robust and
works well on both snippets and longer
documents.

1 Introduction

Baseline discriminative methods for text classifi-
cation usually involve training a linear classifier
over bag-of-words (BoW) representations of doc-
uments. In BoW representations (also known as
Vector Space Models), a document is represented
as a vector where each entry is a count (or binary
count) of tokens that occurred in the document.
Given that some tokens are more informative than
others, a common technique is to apply a weight-
ing scheme to give more weight to discriminative
tokens and less weight to non-discriminative ones.
Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-
idf ) (Salton and McGill, 1983) is an unsupervised
weighting technique that is commonly employed.
In tf-idf, each token i in document d is assigned
the following weight,

wi,d = tfi,d · log N
dfi

(1)

where tfi,d is the number of times token i occurred
in document d, N is the number of documents in
the corpus, and dfi is the number of documents in
which token i occurred.

Many supervised and unsupervised variants of
tf-idf exist (Debole and Sebastiani (2003); Mar-
tineau and Finin (2009); Wang and Zhang (2013)).
The purpose of this paper is not to perform
an exhaustive comparison of existing weighting

schemes, and hence we do not list them here. In-
terested readers are directed to Paltoglou and Thel-
wall (2010) and Deng et al. (2014) for comprehen-
sive reviews of the different schemes.

In the present work, we propose a simple but
novel supervised method to adjust the term fre-
quency portion in tf-idf by assigning a credibil-
ity adjusted score to each token. We find that
it outperforms the traditional unsupervised tf-idf
weighting scheme on multiple benchmarks. The
benchmarks include both snippets and longer doc-
uments. We also compare our method against
Wang and Manning (2012)’s Naive-Bayes Support
Vector Machine (NBSVM), which has achieved
state-of-the-art results (or close to it) on many
datasets, and find that it performs competitively
against NBSVM. We additionally find that the
traditional tf-idf performs competitively against
other, more sophisticated methods when used with
the right scaling and normalization parameters.

2 The Method

Consider a binary classification task. Let Ci,k be
the count of token i in class k, with k ∈ {−1, 1}.
Denote Ci to be the count of token i over both
classes, and y(d) to be the class of document d.
For each occurrence of token i in the training set,
we calculate the following,

s
(j)
i =

{
Ci,1
Ci

, if y(d) = 1
Ci,−1

Ci
, if y(d) = −1 (2)

Here, j is the j-th occurrence of token i. Since
there are Ci such occurrences, j indexes from 1 to
Ci. We assign a score to token i by,

ŝi =
1
Ci

Ci∑
j=1

s
(j)
i (3)

Intuitively, ŝi is the average likelihood of mak-
ing the correct classification given token i’s occur-
rence in the document, if i was the only token in

79



the document. In a binary classification case, this
reduces to,

ŝi =
C2i,1 + C

2
i,−1

C2i
(4)

Note that by construction, the support of ŝi is
[0.5, 1].

2.1 Credibility Adjustment
Suppose ŝi = ŝj = 0.75 for two different tokens
i and j, but Ci = 5 and Cj = 100. Intuition sug-
gests that ŝj is a more credible score than ŝi, and
that ŝi should be shrunk towards the population
mean. Let ŝ be the (weighted) population mean.
That is,

ŝ =
∑

i

Ci · ŝi
C

(5)

where C is the count of all tokens in the corpus.
We define credibility adjusted score for token i to
be,

si =
C2i,1 + C

2
i,−1 + ŝ · γ

C2i + γ
(6)

where γ is an additive smoothing parameter. If
Ci,k’s are small, then si ≈ ŝ (otherwise, si ≈ ŝi).
This is a form of Buhlmann credibility adjustment
from the actuarial literature (Buhlmann and Gisler,
2005). We subsequently define tf , the credibility
adjusted term frequency, to be,

tf i,d = (0.5 + ŝi) · tfi,d (7)

and tf is replaced with tf . That is,

wi,d = tf i,d · log
N

dfi
(8)

We refer to above as cred-tf-idf hereafter.

2.2 Sublinear Scaling
It is common practice to apply sublinear scaling to
tf . A word occurring (say) ten times more in a
document is unlikely to be ten times as important.
Paltoglou and Thelwall (2010) confirm that sub-
linear scaling of term frequency results in signif-
icant improvements in various text classification
tasks. We employ logarithmic scaling, where tf is
replaced with log(tf) + 1. For our method, tf is
simply replaced with log(tf) + 1. We found vir-
tually no difference in performance between log
scaling and other sublinear scaling methods (such
as augmented scaling, where tf is replaced with
0.5 + 0.5+tfmax tf ).

2.3 Normalization

Using normalized features resulted in substan-
tial improvements in performance versus using
un-normalized features. We thus use x̂(d) =
x(d)/||x(d)||2 in the SVM, where x(d) is the fea-
ture vector obtained from cred-tf-idf weights for
document d.

2.4 Naive-Bayes SVM (NBSVM)

Wang and Manning (2012) achieve excellent
(sometimes state-of-the-art) results on many
benchmarks using binary Naive Bayes (NB) log-
count ratios as features in an SVM. In their frame-
work,

wi,d = 1{tfi,d} log (dfi,1 + α)/
∑

i(dfi,1 + α)
(dfi,−1 + α)/

∑
i(dfi,−1 + α)

(9)
where dfi,k is the number of documents that con-
tain token i in class k, α is a smoothing parameter,
and 1{·} is the indicator function equal to one if
tfi,d > 0 and zero otherwise. As an additional
benchmark, we implement NBSVM with α = 1.0
and compare against our results.1

3 Datasets and Experimental Setup

We test our method on both long and short text
classification tasks, all of which were used to es-
tablish baselines in Wang and Manning (2012).
Table 1 has summary statistics of the datasets. The
snippet datasets are:

• PL-sh: Short movie reviews with one sen-
tence per review. Classification involves de-
tecting whether a review is positive or nega-
tive. (Pang and Lee, 2005).2

• PL-sub: Dataset with short subjective movie
reviews and objective plot summaries. Clas-
sification task is to detect whether the sen-
tence is objective or subjective. (Pang and
Lee, 2004).

And the longer document datasets are:

1Wang and Manning (2012) use the same α but they dif-
fer from our NBSVM in two ways. One, they use l2 hinge
loss (as opposed to l1 loss in this paper). Two, they in-
terpolate NBSVM weights with Multivariable Naive Bayes
(MNB) weights to get the final weight vector. Further, their
tokenization is slightly different. Hence our NBSVM results
are not directly comparable. We list their results in table 2.

Table 1: Summary statistics for the datasets.
Length is the average number of unigram tokens
(including punctuation) per document. Pos/Neg is
the number of positive/negative documents in the
training set. Test is the number of documents in
the test set (CV means that there is no separate
test set for this dataset and thus a 10-fold cross-
validation was used to calculate errors).

• PL-2k: 2000 full-length movie reviews that
has become the de facto benchmark for sen-
timent analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004).

• IMDB: 50k full-length movie reviews (25k
training, 25k test), from IMDB (Maas et al.,
2011).3

• AthR, XGraph: The 20-Newsgroup dataset,
2nd version with headers removed.4 Clas-
sification task is to classify which topic a
document belongs to. AthR: alt.atheism vs
religion.misc, XGraph: comp.windows.x vs
comp.graphics.

3.1 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
For each document, we construct the feature vec-
tor x(d) using weights obtained from cred-tf-idf
with log scaling and l2 normalization. For cred-
tf-idf, γ is set to 1.0. NBSVM and tf-idf (also with
log scaling and l2 normalization) are used to es-
tablish baselines. Prediction for a test document is
given by

y(d) = sign (wTx(d) + b) (10)

In all experiments, we use a Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) with a linear kernel and penalty pa-
rameter of C = 1.0. For the SVM, w, b are ob-
tained by minimizing,

wTw+C
N∑

d=1

max(0, 1−y(d)(wTx(d)+b)) (11)

using the LIBLINEAR library (Fan et al., 2008).

3.2 Tokenization

We lower-case all words but do not perform any
stemming or lemmatization. We restrict the vo-
cabulary to all tokens that occurred at least twice
in the training set.

4 Results and Discussion

For PL datasets, there are no separate test sets and
hence we use 10-fold cross validation (as do other
published results) to estimate errors. The standard
train-test splits are used on IMDB and Newsgroup
datasets.

4.1 cred-tf-idf outperforms tf-idf

Table 2 has the comparison of results for the dif-
ferent datasets. Our method outperforms the tra-
ditional tf-idf on all benchmarks for both uni-
grams and bigrams. While some of the differ-
ences in performance are significant at the 0.05
level (e.g. IMDB), some are not (e.g. PL-2k). The
Wilcoxon signed ranks test is a non-parametric
test that is often used in cases where two classi-
fiers are compared over multiple datasets (Dem-
sar, 2006). The Wilcoxon signed ranks test indi-
cates that the overall outperformance is significant
at the <0.01 level.

4.2 NBSVM outperforms cred-tf-idf

cred-tf-idf did not outperform Wang and Manning
(2012)’s NBSVM (Wilcoxon signed ranks test p-
value = 0.1). But it did outperform our own im-
plementation of NBSVM, implying that the ex-
tra modifications by Wang and Manning (2012)
(i.e. using squared hinge loss in the SVM and in-
terpolating between NBSVM and MNB weights)
are important contributions of their methodology.
This was especially true in the case of shorter doc-
uments, where our uninterpolated NBSVM per-
formed significantly worse than their interpolated
NBSVM.

4.3 tf-idf still performs well

We find that tf-idf still performs remarkably well
with the right scaling and normalization parame-
ters. Indeed, the traditional tf-idf outperformed
many of the more sophisticated methods that
employ distributed representations (Maas et al.
(2011); Socher et al. (2011)) or other weighting
schemes (Martineau and Finin (2009); Deng et al.
(2014)).

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we presented a novel supervised
weighting scheme, which we call credibility ad-
justed term frequency, to perform sentiment anal-
ysis and text classification. Our method outper-
forms the traditional tf-idf weighting scheme on
multiple benchmarks, which include both snippets
and longer documents. We also showed that tf-idf
is competitive against other state-of-the-art meth-
ods with the right scaling and normalization pa-
rameters.

From a performance standpoint, it would be in-
teresting to see if our method is able to achieve
even better results on the above tasks with proper
tuning of the γ parameter. Relatedly, our method
could potentially be combined with other super-
vised variants of tf-idf, either directly or through
ensembling, to improve performance further.
