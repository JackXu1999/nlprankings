Abstract
This paper describes the approach adopted by
the SMarT research group to build a dialect
identification system in the framework of the
Madar shared task on Arabic fine-grained di-
alect identification. We experimented several
approaches, but we finally decided to use a
Multinomial Naı̈ve Bayes classifier based on
word and character ngrams in addition to the
language model probabilities. We achieved a
score of 67.73% in terms of Macro accuracy
and a macro-averaged F1-score of 67.31%.

1 Introduction

Arabic is a complex language which presents sig-
nificant challenges for natural language process-
ing and its applications. Arabic is characterized
by its plurality. It consists of a wide variety of lan-
guages, which includes the Modern Standard Ara-
bic (MSA), and a set of various dialects differing
according to regions and countries.
Language identification is the task of identifying
the language of a given text. It is an important pre-
processing step for many Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation
(Meftouh et al., 2018; Harrat et al., 2017), senti-
ment analysis (Rana et al., 2016; Abdul-Mageed
et al., 2014; Saad et al., 2013), etc. In general,
language identification is not a high challenging
issue since this research has been supported for a
long time and several machine learning techniques
have been tested in this area that yielded to more
or less good results. Nonetheless, in cases such as
identifying languages from very little data, from
mixed input or when the languages are extremely
close to each other, the task becomes very chal-
lenging (Goutte et al., 2014).
This paper describes the submission of Loria
(SMarT research group) to the Madar shared task
on Arabic fine-grained dialect identification cover-
ing 25 specific cities from across the Arab World,

in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (Bouamor
et al., 2019). This shared task is the first to target
a large set of dialect labels at the city and country
levels. It has two subtasks.

Subtask 1: MADAR Travel Domain Dialect
Identification.

Subtask 2: MADAR Twitter User Dialect Identi-
fication.

Our submission to this campaign is dealing with
the first subtask.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: in the next section, we discuss related work
pertaining to Arabic dialect identification. Section
3 reviews the modeling choices we made for the
shared task, and Section 4 describes results in de-
tail.

2 Related Work

Several research works addressed the problem
of Arabic dialect identification. The authors of
Habash et al. (2008) presented standard annota-
tion guidelines to identify the switching between
the MSA and at least one dialect. These guide-
lines can be used to annotate large collections of
data used for training and testing NLP tools. In
Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2012), a large anno-
tated dataset, created by harvesting an important
number of reader commentaries on online news-
papers content, is used to train and evaluate auto-
matic classifiers for dialect detection and identi-
fication. The authors crowdsourced an annotation
task to obtain sentence-level labels indicating what
proportion of the sentence is dialectal, and which
dialect the sentence is written in. The approach
used in dialect identification relies on training lan-
guage models for the different varieties of Ara-
bic. Another work presents a supervised approach
for performing sentence level dialect identification



260

between Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian
Dialectal Arabic (Elfardy and Diab, 2013). The
authors use token level labels to derive sentence-
level features. These features are then used with
other core and meta features to train a generative
classifier that predicts the correct label for each
sentence in the given input text. In addition to a
multi-dialect, multi-genre, human annotated cor-
pus, the authors in Cotterell and Callison-Bursh
(2014) present the results of a language identifi-
cation task extended to include 5 dialects. They
considered Naı̈ve Bayes and Support Vector Ma-
chines. The approach used by Darwish et al.
(2014) for the identification of the Egyptian dialect
was based on lexical, morphological and phono-
logical information. They show that accounting
for such information can improve dialect detec-
tion accuracy by nearly 10%. Using a set of sur-
face features based on characters and words Mal-
masi et al. (2015) conduct three experiments with
a linear SVM classifier and a meta-classifier us-
ing stacked generalization on the Multidialectal
Parallel Corpus of Arabic (MPCA) compiled by
Bouamor et al. (2014). They first conduct a 6-
way multi-dialect classification task then investi-
gate pairwise binary dialect classification and fi-
nally conduct cross-corpus evaluation on the Ara-
bic Online Commentary (AOC) dataset. In Al-
Badrashiny et al. (2015), the authors present a hy-
brid approach for performing token and sentence
levels Arabic Dialect Identification. The token
level component relies on a Conditional Random
Field (CRF) classifier that take decisions based on
several underlying components such as language
models, a named entity recognizer and a morpho-
logical analyzer to label each word in the sentence.
The sentence level component uses an ensemble
of classifiers that models different aspects of the
language. In another work, Al-Badrashiny and
Diab (2016) present a system that detects points
of code-switching in sentences between the MSA
and dialectal Arabic. In Sadat et al. (2014), the
authors present a bi-gram character-level model
to identify the dialect of sentences, in the social
media context, among dialects of 18 Arab coun-
tries. Bougrine et al. (2015) addressed the prob-
lem of spoken Algerian dialect identification by
using prosodic speech information (intonation and
rhythm). They performed an experiment on six di-
alects from different Algerian regions. In Salameh
et al. (2018), the authors present the first system

dealing with fine-grained dialect classification task
and covering 25 specific cities from across the
Arab World, in addition to Standard Arabic. For
this purpose, they build several classification sys-
tems using a Multinomial Naı̈ve Bayes classifier
and exploring a large space of features.

3 The Modeling Choices

3.1 Data
For the experiments reported in this paper, we only
use the training and the development data avail-
able in the subtask 1 of the shared task. The
dataset of this subtask is the same as the one re-
ported on Bouamor et al. (2018) and Salameh et al.
(2018). It is composed of two corpora. The first
(Corpus-26) is a collection of parallel sentences,
built to cover the dialects of 25 cities from the
Arab World, in addition to MSA. The training part
consists of 1600 labeled instances per class, while
the development part has 200 labeled instances per
class. The second (Corpus-6) contains 10, 000 ad-
ditional sentences translated to the dialects of only
five cities: Beirut, Cairo, Doha, Tunis and Rabat,
in addition to MSA. They are splitted on two cate-
gories: 9, 000 instances per language for the train-
ing and 1, 000 instances per language for the de-
velopment.

3.2 Method
In order to develop a language identification sys-
tem that can distinguish between several Arabic
dialects, we tested three methods namely sim-
ple neural networks (LSTM) (Sak et al., 2015),
a method based on word embedding (Word2vec)
(Mikolov et al., 2013) and Naı̈ve Bayes classifiers.
Given the limited size of the provided corpora, the
first two methods have proven ineffective. We give
in Table ?? the results we obtain using Corpus 26
in terms of Macro averaged F1-score, precision
and recall.

Corpus 26
Method Precision Recall F1-score
Word2vec 50.11 49.90 49.74
LSTM 58.04 61.54 58.33

Table 1: Macro averaged F1-score, Precison and Recall
for Word2vec and LSTM method.

We used a Naı̈ve Bayes method because in the
past, we did a comparative study of methods for
Topic identification. This method for French leads



261

to the best results (Bigi et al., 2001). In this work
we consider a Multinomial Naı̈ve Bayes classi-
fier, in fact a study proposed in McCallum and
Nigam (1998) showed that the multinomial model
is found to be almost better than the multivari-
ate Bernoulli model and the experimental results
yielded to better results. So, we consider a Multi-
nomial Naı̈ve Bayes classifier for this task. In this
case, the term Multinomial Naı̈ve Bayes lets us
know that each p(fi|c) (where fi is a feature and
c the category or the class) is a multinomial distri-
bution, rather than some other distribution such as
a Bernoulli distribution.
To develop our system, we used Python, relying
on Scikit-Learn module (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

3.3 Features
A Naı̈ve Bayes model classifier identifies a cate-
gory by calculating the distributions of the features
within a category. It also assumes that each of the
features it uses are conditionally independent of
one another given a category. Identifying features
is a critical step when applying Naı̈ve Bayes clas-
sifiers. That is why we did several experiments to
select some adequate features. After several ex-
periments, we selected for each sentence, the fol-
lowing 38 features as follows:

• A unigram of words.

• A bigram of words

• Character n-grams: from 1 to 5

• Character n-grams: from 1 to 5, by taking
into account the spaces between words; in
other words ngrams at the edges of words are
padded with space. All the symbols of punc-
tuation have been removed from the training,
development and test data.

• 26 likelihoods estimated by the 26 unigram
language models

For all the features, we use a special character
to mark the start of the sentences. We utilize Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (Tf-Idf)
scores (Spärck Jones, 1972) as it has been shown
to outperform count weights in several NLP appli-
cations.

4 Results and Discussion

For the purpose of this campaign, we built sev-
eral systems using the model described in section

3. We did several experiments to determine the
smoothing adding value, necessary for the Naive
Bayes method, and we set it to 0.093 for all the
systems. In Table 2, we report the results of
all the experiments concerning the Multinomial
Naive Bayes method. For the evaluation purpose,
we use the Macro averaged F1-score which is re-
tained as the official metric by the organizers of
Madar shared task.

Test sets for Corpus-26.

First, we train the multinomial NB on word
ngrams. The best results are achieved with the
use of unigrams and bigrams. For higher order of
n-grams, the performance of the model degrades
due to the data sparsity. Then, we tested the effect
of character ngrams features with (wi) and with-
out (wo) taking into account the space at the end
of the words. We experimented using the features
of each option alone and combined. In Table 2
the symbol x-y means that all the n-grams features
from x to y of the corresponding column are taken
into account in the classification.
In all the experiments, the best model is obtained
for n ranging from 1 to 5. We remark that a classi-
fier based on character ngrams features (1-5) out-
performs the classifier based on word ngrams fea-
tures by at least 3 points. Finally, the best classi-
fier is the one using word unigrams and bigrams,
and character ngrams ranging from 1 to 5 with and
without space. The introduction of the language
model features improved the result on the devel-
opment corpus and reduced it on the test corpus.
We decided finally to participate to the campaign



262

with the classifier including the language model
parameters.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we described the experiments we
conducted as part of the MADAR shared task on
Arabic fine-grained dialect identification. This
task is the first covering the dialects of 25 specific
cities from across the Arab World, in addition to
MSA. Thus, we tested several systems exploring
a large set of features. A blind run on the test
set was then performed and submitted as part of
the shared task. The Macro accuracy is 67.73%
(macro-averaged F1-score 67.31%), placing our
classifier first among 19 participants. This result
shows that our approach despite its simplicity per-
forms very well and even if it is ranked first, we
need to make more efforts to make it powerful so
that it can become an effective tool for the com-
munity.
