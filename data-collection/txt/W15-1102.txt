Abstract

Linguistic alignment, such as lexical
and syntactic alignment, is a universal
phenomenon influencing dialogue participants
in online conversations. While adaptation
can occur at lexical, syntactic and pragmatic
levels, relationships between alignments at
multiple levels are neither theoretically nor
empirically well understood. In this study,
we find that community members show
pragmatic alignment on social support type,
distinguishing emotional and informational
support, both of which provide benefits to
members. We also find that lexical alignment
is correlated with emotional support. This
finding can contribute to our understanding
of the linguistic signature of different types
of support as well as the theory of Interactive
Alignment in dialogue.

1 Introduction

Linguistic alignment is a psycholinguistic
phenomenon that causes dialogue participants
to adjust their language patterns to those of
their conversation partners. These linguistic
patterns include words (Gries, 2005), syntax
(Bock, 1986; Branigan et al., 2000; Jaeger and
Snider, 2007), gestures (Bergmann and Kopp,
2012) and more. This phenomenon has been well
examined and explored under experimental settings
(Fusaroli et al., 2012; Reitter and Moore, 2007), in
naturalistic discourse (Gries, 2005; Reitter et al.,
2006), as well as in online conversations (Huffaker
et al., 2006; Scissors et al., 2008; Backstrom et al.,
2013), social media, and fictional dialogue in

film scripts (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee,
2011). Moreover, according to the Interactive
Alignment Model (IAM) (Pickering and Garrod,
2004), linguistic alignment has been suspected to
be a driver of mutual understanding, building up
over different levels (lexicon, syntax, situation,
pragmatic, agreement).

Alignment is a universal phenomenon that
reaches beyond the linguistic decisions we make
once we have decided to communicate an idea.
Pragmatics is commonly taken to refer to the
way we express and understand communications in
context, encoding higher-level intent. How people
understand words and phrases in a given situation is
indeed subject to alignment (Garrod and Anderson,
1987). Generally, games can elucidate pragmatic
reasoning and mutual adaptation thereof (Frank and
Goodman, 2012). To the best of our knowledge,
there is no prior report of pragmatic alignment in
naturalistic situations. For the purposes of this study,
we define the pragmatics of an utterance as the
intended effect on the reader or listener, regardless
of the way it is semantically expressed. Unlike
in pragmatics in linguistics, however, our focus is
not on the differences between explicitly stated and
implied meaning.

The first question this paper will focus on is
analyzing pragmatic alignment in naturalistic
dialogue, specifically in internet forum
conversation. To understand what we mean by
higher-level semantics or pragmatics in these data,
we need to understand the motivation and dynamics
of these communities.

An increasing number of people with serious

9



disease seek and give social support in group
discussions in online social networks such as
Facebook and online health support communities.
Basically, there are four types of social support,
emotional support, informational support,
tangible/instrumental support and appraisal support
(Langford et al., 1997; Malecki and Demaray, 2003).
In online communities, the social support exchange
is primarily of an informational or emotional
nature (Wang et al., 2012; Rimer et al., 2005).
Understandably, people with a life-threatening
illness are in need of both information, such as
side-effects of a specific drug, and emotional care,
such as empathy. Previous research on behavior
analysis, such as stress-buffering theory (Cohen
and McKay, 1984), also suggested that exchanging
useful social support protects people from stressful
and pathological events. Analyzing the social
support and the kind of support conveyed in the
messages will be of benefit to support-oriented
community building. Furthermore, previous studies
(Zhao et al., 2014) suggested that earlier responses
to a new support seeking request help predict
leaders in self-supported communities. Although,
the proportion of emotional or informational
support in a message can, of course, be influenced
by many factors, such as previous messages in
the conversation, word choices and personality.
Nevertheless, we use this measure for further
analysis. From the alignment perspective, we will
focus on whether people tend to align in the type
of support in online health communities. In other
words, we first analyze the pragmatic alignment
phenomenon, which is defined as alignment of
the type of support provided by one community
member to another. We validate it in one of the
largest online health communities, Cancer Survivor
Network. To the best of our knowledge, pragmatic
alignment in online communities has not been
explored yet.

The second question is whether we could find
evidence for or against the Interactive Alignment
Model (Pickering and Garrod, 2004) in this dataset.
As IAM suggested, alignment at different levels
is linked, building up from lower-level adaptation.
At a functional level, linguistic alignment
indicates and may help build social relationships
(Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee, 2011), reveal

social status (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al.,
2011; Jones et al., 2014) and strengthen situational
awareness in dialogic tasks (Fusaroli et al., 2012;
Reitter and Moore, 2007, 2014).

Thus, an important question in this context is
whether adaptation also applies to higher-level
pragmatic goals, such as providing support
that is more informational or more emotional.
Convergence at lower levels would theoretically be
expected to correlate to higher-level convergence,
and conversations that show convergence would be
expected to be more effective. Do priming effects at
levels of lexicon and syntax influence the proportion
of the type of support in a message within the
conversation? We predict that social support
adaptation exists in thread based discussions.
Theoretically, we would also expect that low-level
priming facilitates any social support adaptation we
find.

To sum up, there are two concrete questions we
will address in this paper:

• (1) Does the type of support (i.e, emotional vs.
informational) provided by early responders
(i.e, first responder) on a thread influence the
type of support provided by later responders in
self-support communities?

• (2) Does lexical and syntactic alignment
(henceforth “linguistic alignment”) between
early responders and later responders correlate
to the type of support matching?

The alignment we are concerned with would
clearly happen at the level of communicative intent.
We consider this pragmatics. The pragmatics we
refer to is not the same as it’s used in linguistics
concerning contextual and indirect interpretation of
sentence semantics, but rather the sense of intent,
in a psychological sense. In psychology, pragmatic
communication comprises social and conventional
messages that take the recipient’s needs into
account. Social support adaptation specifically
considers the unspoken rule that we perceive an
interlocutor’s emotional and informational needs
and react accordingly.

Some studies in behavior analysis (Backstrom
et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2014) showed that word
use in the conversations may influence members’

10



behavior in the communities. Althoff et al.
(2014) stated that request presentation influences
members’ feedbacks in a variety of ways, such
as sentiment, politeness and length of reply posts.
Cheng et al. (2014) mentioned that members’
feedbacks also shapes users’ behavior in the
communities. Furthermore, automated content (Qiu
et al., 2011) and discourse analysis using machine
learning methods provided important insights about
the benefits and causal relationships (Bui et al.,
2015) with support behaviors in online health
communities. Thus, modeling members’ feedbacks
at the pragmatic level could help us build better
communities.

A recent study from Vlahovic et al. (2014) was
similar to our study. They used profit regression
to predict members’ satisfaction after receiving
emotional and informational support in a breast
cancer online support community. For one thread, a
trained profit regression model predicted the thread
initiators’ satisfaction scale from 1 to 7. In this
study, both receiving emotional and informational
support increased thread initiators’ satisfaction in
general. However, if a thread initiator received
support that did not match the type requested, this
user’s satisfaction decreased. In this work, we focus
on whether previous messages will influence other
responders’ behavior in the ensuing conversation.

2 Measures

In this paper, we use adaptation measures at
two levels, linguistic alignment and pragmatic
similarity. Linguistic alignment quantifies by how
much conversation participants adapt their language
patterns to those of their interlocutors. Studies differ
in the kinds of patterns examined: Some approaches
measure linguistic adaptation using Linguistic
Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Tausczik and
Pennebaker, 2010; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al.,
2011), and some focus on functional words (Jones
et al., 2014). Other approaches measure repetition
of words or syntactic rules (Church, 2000; Dubey
et al., 2005; Fusaroli et al., 2012; Gries, 2005;
Reitter et al., 2006). We use Indiscriminate
Local Linguistic Alignment (Fusaroli et al., 2012)
to measure linguistic alignment in this paper.
Pragmatic similarity, for the purposes of the present

study, evaluates the degree of matching social
support types in conversation messages. In the
following, we will introduce these measures.

2.1 Linguistic Alignment Measures
In this paper, we implement Indiscriminate Local
Linguistic Alignment (Fusaroli et al., 2012) at lexical
and syntactic levels to evaluate linguistic alignment.
Generally, it measures the repetition of linguistic
patterns among messages in the same conversation.

To be specific, Lexical Indiscriminate Local
Linguistic Alignment (LILLA) measures word
repetition between between pairs of messages
(Wang et al., 2014; Fusaroli et al., 2012). The
messages, ordered by occurrence in a thread of
messages, will be called prime post and target post,
respectively. In this study, they will sampled from
the Cancer Support Network corpus. Formally,
LILLA is calculated as

LILLA(target, prime) =∑
wordi�target

δ(wordi)
length(prime) ∗ length(target) (1)

δ(wordi) =
{

1 if wordi � prime
0 otherwise

(2)

where length(X) is the number of words in post X.
We also measure syntactic alignment. Every

sentence in each post is annotated with phrase
structure trees using the Stanford CoreNLP parser
(Klein and Manning, 2003). Each syntax tree is
translated to a series of syntactic rules to encode
the sequence of syntactic decisions. Syntactic
Indiscriminate Local Linguistic Alignment (SILLA)
is analogous to LILLA and measures repetition of
syntactic rules between prime and target post pair,
where length(X) in SILLA is the number of rules in
post X. (Fusaroli et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014).

2.2 Support Measures
As discussed above, emotional support and
informational support are two most major support
types in self support health communities (Wang
et al., 2012; Rimer et al., 2005). Emotional
support gives individual a feeling that s/he is cared
for, or the facility of “understanding/empathy,
encouragement, affirmation/validation, sympathy,

11



and caring/concern” (Bambina, 2007). Emotional
support does not include information. Here is an
example of emotional support in CSN: “I pray
for you every night XXX.....and send you hugs and
encouragement....you have the very BEST attitude
and you must have a totally wonderful family. Love,
XX”

However, different from emotional support,
informational support provides facts, advices and
referrals (Bambina, 2007). Also, in our case,
informational support only provides experience
and information, without any emotional support.
Another example of informational support in our
data is: ”I am having similar problem with sacrum
and hip, however not ready for biopsy in those areas.
If you can tolerate pain waiting for new drugs to
come will be beneficial. a new drug palbociclib
(PD-0332991) expected to receive FDA approval in
April of 2015”.

In order to quantify the amount of one type of
support in a reply post, we quantify the amount
of one type of support (i.e. informational support,
emotional support) in a comment post as support
index Biyani et al. (2014), as follows: Indextype =
numtype/numclassified, which is the proportion of
sentences of a specific type in a post.

We will predict the emotional support index,
Indexemo = 1 − Indexinfo (for presentational
reasons). The measure is produced automatically
using the previously published classifier (Biyani
et al., 2014).

3 Data Description

The data we use in this paper is from Cancer
Survivor’s Network (CSN) (csn.cancer.org),
which is the largest active online community for
cancer survivors. The CSN contains more than
166,000 users and 41 sub-communities (Portier
et al., 2013). Users in one sub-community have
experienced the same primary disease, similar health
issues, surgeries. Furthermore, many users express
depression. Most of the discussions in CSN are
goal-directed and support-oriented conversations,
which attracted our attention. Users would like to
exchange their experiences and emotions in facing
these tough situations.

We used threads from two largest sub-forums

in the CSN: Breast cancer and Colorectal cancer.
These sub-forums contain posts from the period
of June 2000 to October 2010. The majority of
posts in the breast cancer sub-forum are from female
members, while most posts in the colorectal cancer
sub-forum were authored by male patients. Thus,
the two corpora are from relatively distinct, but
representative user groups.

Mirroring the structure of other online
communities, we refer to an initial post followed
by a sequence of reply post as a thread. We treat
the structure of these threads as a sequence of plain
texts in temporal order, as members often use a
general “reply” button to initiate replies, even when
such messages are direct replies to a post. Thus,
more detailed post relationships within each thread
are sparse and not very reliable. A discussion
thread is represented as a sequence of posts,
< P0, P1, · · · , Pi, · · · , Pn >, where P0 is called
initial post, P1 is called the first reply of one thread
(simply called first reply) and the author of initial
post is called the thread initiator. In most cases, the
rest of replies provide help and emotional support
to the thread initiator. The variable i is called
the absolute position of post Pi. Posts in which
the thread initiator replies to his or her message
are excluded (as thread initiator may not provide
support to themselves). The number of replies in a
thread (without the initial post) is called the length
of that thread. Both sub-communities have similar
distributions of thread length. 90% of threads in
Breast Cancer forum and Colorectal Cancer forum
are shorter than 23 and 19, respectively.

We used a binary sentence classifier described by
Biyani et al. (2014), which classifies sentences as
providing either emotional or informational support.
The classifier was trained in that work on more than
1, 000 hand-annotated sentences; annotators reached
89% initial agreement. The classifier uses a variety
of features, including subjective and cancer-related
words, part-of-speech, phrases indicating support
types. It yields an F-measure of 0.840.

4 Method

We treat the first reply of a thread as the prime,
and each following reply as a target; thus, we
include several prime-target data points per thread.

Colorectal Cancer 2,348 13,282 125,527 112,602 4.85%

To address our first and second research questions,
we fit a generalized linear mixed effects regression
model with binominal kernel to predict the support
index of a reply post given lexical and syntactical
alignment measures, the support index in the first
reply, post distance, number of sentences of that
post and interactions terms among predictors in the
thread. All the predictors in the model have been
rescaled (but not centered).

4.1 Covariates

As a reminder, the model predicts the support index
of a reply post (response variable) as a function of
the following variables and interaction terms based
on the previous work Wang et al. (2014). While
the predicted informational support level is the sum
of all predictors, pragmatic alignment is indicated
as a positive correlation between the first reply’s
information support index and the response variable
(see Table 3).

First Reply Support Index: This variable
measures the proportion of informational support
sentences in the post. A positive estimate (β) would
indicate positive correlation of support type between
the posts.

Post Distance: The distance between the data
point (current post) and first reply in the thread can
be seen as a proxy for how much information has
been discussed so far in this thread, or for how
much time has elapsed between the posts. A large
post distance indicates that a post is far away from
the initial post. Distance is measured in number of
posts, as this is the most informative number: dates
and times are not indicative of when a member has
actually read the posts. Distance is interesting in
our context, as the priming effect decays rapidly, as
shown previously for the case of this corpus (Wang
et al., 2014).

Linguistic Alignment: As discussed in the
previous section, we use two linguistic alignment
measures, Linguistic Alignment (LILLA) and
Syntactic Alignment (SILLA) to link the linguistic
to support index. This main effect helps us address
the second research question.

Number of Sentences: This variable approximates
the complexity and the amount of information in a
given post.

Interaction terms between first reply Support
Index and Post Distance: The distance effect on
pragmatic alignment would indicate a decay effect
which is similar to decay previous observations for
linguistic repetition (Reitter et al., 2006).

Interaction terms between first reply Support
Index and Linguistic Alignment Measurement: To
address our second research question, we measure
the correlation between linguistic alignment and
support matching.

Interaction terms between Linguistic Alignment
and Post Distance: These two interaction terms
evaluate a correlation between linguistic decay and
support index, which follows the IAM’s cascade of
alignment effects at different representational levels.

4.2 Experimental Settings

We treat predicting online social support as a
generalized mixed effects linear regression with
binomial kernel (e.g., Jaeger, 2008). Compared
to other black-box machine learning algorithms,
such as SVM, this model is directly interpretable.
It predicts the probability of a message being
emotional/informational support message using
logit-link kernel. In this regression model, we also
consider the effect of different threads. This is of
concern because social support types in different
posts influenced by various topics and authors of
initial posts. Therefore, we employ a logistic

ThreadID.

We use the lme4 R package (Bates et al.,
2014). To evaluate the performance of drop one
feature off models, we give conditional pseudo
R-squared (pseudo R-sq), Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). The
conditional R squared shows the proportion of
variance explained (Barto, 2014, using R package
MuMIN). AIC and BIC are measures of the quality
of logistic regression model of current dataset.

All results reported in Table 2 are produced
from 10 random sub-sampling validation with 70%
training and 30% testing splits of threads.

4.3 Experiment Results

Table 3 reports effect sizes and directions, and
Table 2 gives the performance of the informational
support index prediction using generalized mixed
effects linear regression model with binomial kernel.
In Table 2, it shows the pseudo R-squared, AIC and
BIC of models for different set of features and the

full model.1

Overall, the full model which considers all
the features we have listed out-performs other
models. From the proportion of explained variable
perspective (R-squared), it shows that the linguistic
alignment and informational support index of the
first reply are the two most important predictors, and
increase a relatively larger proportion of variance
explained in the model. Also, interaction terms
considerably improve the model performance.

We rebuilt the model using the whole dataset
in order to show and interpret effects of different
predictors. The estimates and associated p-values
given in Table 3 pertain to the two best models,
predicting informational support index separately
for the two sub-forums.

5 Discussion

Initially, we focus on the effect of the first
reply support index addressing research question 1,
whether online support provided by early responders

1We use the AIC scores to select the best generalized mixed
effects linear regression model with binomial kernel, since AIC
score evaluates the model based on both goodness of fit and
model complexity (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).

influences the support index of replies from later
responders. According to the regression models
in Table 3, the support index of the first reply is
positively correlated with the support indices of the
later replies in both datasets. In short, people align
at the pragmatic level when it comes to overall
communicative intent. The intent of the first reply
is matched by the intent shown in future replies.

Similar to linguistic alignment effects, we also
consider the post distance effect. Previous studies
(Reitter et al., 2006) showed that strong syntactic
adaptation diminishes in seconds in spoken dialogue
corpora. This phenomenon also has been found
for individual syntactic constructions in written
and spoken language (see Pickering and Ferreira,
2008, for a review) and also in dialogues in online
communities (Wang et al., 2014). In order to
test and measure the effect of early messages
on later messages, we examine whether support
index has the same characteristic. There are two
components to an answer. First, the regression
model (Table 3) suggests that informational support
index generally decreases by post distance. In
other words, less informational support is given as
discussions proceed. It is worthwhile to note that

conversations shift towards emotional support in
this support-oriented community. Does alignment
decay by distance? This answer is given by the
interaction between distance and support index of
the first reply. Evidence for such decay is weak: we
have no support for decay in the Breast Cancer case,
and some decay (β = −0.244, p = 0.057) in the
Colorectal Cancer forum.

Another notable result is how linguistic and
pragmatic alignment interact. The LILLA measure
quantifies lexical adaptation between messages.
Lexical alignment is reliably indicative of emotional
support (negative information support) in both
forums. The reasons for this correlation may be
found in properties of informational support in
both datasets. Informational support provided at
a later time is likely to include new information,
introducing new words. Emotional support, on the
other hand, implies more consistent word choice.
Syntactic adaptation (SILLA) shows no effect of
syntactic alignment on support index.

To address our second initial question, we
also evaluate the relationship of linguistic and
pragmatic alignment using interaction terms
between Linguistic Alignment and first reply

15



Support Index. From a theoretical perspective and
previous empirical results, we expect to see that
adaptation is consistent across different linguistic
choices: it may be due to a cascade of priming
effects and joint situational understanding (Garrod
and Pickering, 2009), joint languages (Fusaroli
et al., 2012), and/or a cognitive (memory) process
that is common to the different choices (Reitter
et al., 2011). We find a strong positive interaction
between lexical alignment and Informational
Support Index in the first reply. This means that
when first-reply (prime) and other-reply (target)
align in terms of their kinds of social support, then
they also tend to show much more lexical alignment.
The same cannot be said for the syntactic level.

Linguistic adaptation is correlated with high-level
alignment. In order to validate this theoretical
effect on our corpora, we observe interaction effects
between lexical alignment and the support type
alignment. We caution the reader, however, that this
interaction effect is expected given that our measure
of support type is a function not least of word
choices. Thus, these predictors are by no means
independent. However, as stated before, lexical
alignment also correlates with stronger emotional
support. The interaction effect of lexical alignment
and post distance, present in both datasets, suggests
that in later portions of each thread, lexical
alignment is no longer predictive of such emotional
support.

To summarize, the observations of main effects
suggest that the type of support provided by early
responders on the thread positively influences the
type of support provided by later responders in our
data. That is, pragmatic adaptation based on support
index exists in our data. Also, the observations
provide clues that informational support messages
are more likely to be provided at the beginning of
the thread discussions.

Moreover, with regard to our research question
2, there is a correlation between some linguistic
alignment measurements and support index.
Naturally, these results are observational: taken by
themselves, they suggest no causality. We make
our argument solely because the hypotheses tested
were motivated by theoretical predictions. Our
results are compatible with a theoretical perspective
that explains mutual understanding and successful

communication as being aided by a cascade of
priming or language adaptation effects (Pickering
and Garrod, 2004).

6 Conclusion

Motivated by the large proportion of online social
support in peer-to-peer support online communities,
we quantify and predict online support in the
thread-based conversations. In a regression
model, we have considered multiple factors, such
as previous messages, linguistic alignment, and
complexity. The results point to alignment
phenomena at a pragmatic level. Such alignment
tends to coincide with alignment of word choices.
Both of these results are, to our knowledge novel.
The interpretation of our regression model is
congruent with the interactive alignment theory
(Pickering and Garrod, 2004).

From an applied perspective the models we fitted
to the forum data could facilitate filters to display
certain useful posts, or to improve ranking of search
results after analyzing a specific users’ needs (i.e.
providing results with high informational support
index for seeking informational support). We
believe that it might help health communities to
improve user experience.
