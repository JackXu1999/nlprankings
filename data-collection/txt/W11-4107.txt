Abstract 

The dictionaries are among the well-
known tools for applications in everyday 
life, education, sciences, humanities, and 
human communication. The recent de-
velopments of information technologies 
contribute to the design and creation of 
new software tools with a wide range of 
applications, especially for natural lan-
guage processing. The paper presents an 
online bilingual dictionary as a techno-
logical tool for applications in digital 
humanities, and describes the structure 
and content of the bilingual Lexical Da-
tabase supporting a Bulgarian-Polish 
online dictionary. It focuses especially on 
the presentation of verbs, which form the 
richest from a specific characteristics 
viewpoint linguistic category in Bulgar-
ian. The main software modules for web-
presentation of this digital dictionary are 
also shortly described.  

1 Introduction 
Recent developments in information technology 
have been successfully implemented in natural 
language processing, producing numerous tools 
with a wide range of applications. Digital dic-
tionaries, being large-scale data repositories, are 
a popular tool for applications in everyday life, 
education, social sciences and digital humanities. 
Actually, every dictionary contains a large 
amount of language data, but a digital one con-
tains incomparably more because it is a dynamic 
collection of dictionary entries and has the poten-
tial for infinite growth: new entries can be added 
without limitation.  

All kinds of digital data are now accessible 
from remote computers via the Net. Online dic-
tionaries freely published in Internet are accessi-
ble to every user through a URL-address. In or-
der to use this kind of dictionary, the user does 

not need any necessary hardware on the local 
computer or any installation of necessary soft-
ware. The only condition is that the user's com-
puter be equipped with a web browser. This is 
why online dictionaries are so easy to distribute 
and use. A programmer of such software can eas-
ily and promptly correct any potential shortcom-
ing that arises, since the application is installed 
on a web-server. Another advantage of online 
dictionaries is the possibility of changes in their 
content such as deletion or addition of new dic-
tionary entries.  

The first Bulgarian-Polish online dictionary 
was designed to be a general purpose dictionary 
oriented to the casual user and be available by 
open access via the Net. Authorized users can be 
provided with the ability to include within entries 
links to other entries, and to update or edit easily 
online (through the correction of eventual mis-
takes, or the addition of new entries or new in-
formation about headwords).  

For the realization of these purposes a bilin-
gual lexical database (LDB) supporting such a 
web-based dictionary and ensuring a good search 
system has to be developed. Besides, whenever 
possible the LDB should automatically generate 
a new (whether a single or multiple) structure/s 
of entries for the Polish-Bulgarian dictionary us-
ing the appropriate information from a Bulgar-
ian-Polish entry. 

The building of bilingual digital dictionaries is 
a complex and difficult process, due to the scar-
city of formal models that adequately reflect the 
specific linguistic features of a given natural lan-
guage. The lexical database has been chosen as a 
technological platform to support the Bulgarian-
Polish online dictionary for free presentation and 
open access in the Internet.  

The design of the Bulgarian-Polish LDB fol-
lows the CONCEDE model for dictionary encod-
ing with some extensions and modifications. The 
project CONCEDE1 has built lexical databases 

                                                 
1 CONCEDE INCO-Copernicus project no. PL96-1142 
Consortium for Central European Dictionary Encoding 

43



in a general-purpose document-interchange for-
mat, for the six Central and East European lan-
guages: Bulgarian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, 
Romanian, and Slovene.  

The project has produced lexical resources 
that respect the guidelines for encoding diction-
aries (Ide and Véronis, 1995) and so are com-
patible with other TEI-conformant resources. 

The LDB model offers a standardized hierar-
chical tree-structure of a dictionary entry with a 
understandable semantics. It is formally de-
scribed in (Erjavec et al., 2000, 2003).  

The first LDB for Bulgarian was developed 
under the CONCEDE project. It contains more 
than 2700 lexical entries (Dimitrova et al., 2002) 
prepared in accordance with encoding standards 
established by the TEI (Text Encoding Initia-
tive). The Bulgarian LDB is based on the Bulgar-
ian Explanatory Dictionary (Andreychin et al. 
1994). 

2 Bulgarian-Polish Lexical Database  
The monolingual CONCEDE LDBs used two 
types of tags encoded according to the TEI: 
structural tags and content tags.  

The bilingual dictionary needs a bilingual 
LDB. To meet the set goal, the CONCEDE mod-
el had to modified first and the monolingual 
LDB had to be extended to a bilingual one. Sec-
ond, new tags were added to the bilingual LDS to 
cover more of the specific features of Bulgarian 
and Polish aiming more adequate presentation of 
both Slavic languages. 

The brief description of the Bulgarian-Polish 
LDB tag set follows.  

2.1 The structural tags of the Bulgarian-
Polish LDB 

Just like the CONCEDE LDB, the Bulgarian-
Polish LDB uses three structural tags: entry, 
struc, alt. Each structural tag plays a 
corresponding role as follows:  

alt: shows an alternation, nevertheless 
generally used in quite different contexts 

entry: indicates main units of the BDB – 
dictionary entry 

struc: indicates separate independent part 
(structure) in the dictionary entry. The type of 
this part is determined by the sub-tag type. The 
values of the type are modified “Sense” or a new 
one “Function”. 

The structure of a new type "Function" is 
introduced in order to represent different 
grammatical functions of some Bulgarian words, 

because the translation correspondences in Polish 
are different. The index of type "Function" 
counts the groups of grammatical functions that 
correspond to a particular part of speech of the 
specified Bulgarian word.  

For example, for the following entry 

приятелски adi. przyjacielski; adv. po 
przyjacielsku 

two structures of type “Function” are created. 
The first structure (index n=”1”) represents the 
grammatical function adjective of a headword 
“приятелски”/friendly/ (part of speech is 
adjective), and the second structure (index 
n=”2”) represents the grammatical function 
adverb (part of speech is adverb):  
<entry> 
<hw>приятелски</hw> 
<struc type =”Function” n="1"> 

<pos>adi</pos> 
<struc type=”Sense” n=”1”> 
<trans>przyjacielski</trans> 
</struc> 

</struc> 
<struc type =”Function” n="2"> 

<pos>adv</pos> 
<struc type=”Sense” n=”1”> 
<trans>po przyjacielsku</trans> 
</struc> 

</struc> 
</entry> 

Note: Latin abbreviations adi /adiectivum/ for 
adjective and adv /adverbium/ for adverb are 
used. 

2.2 The content tags of the Bulgarian-Polish 
LDB 

The set of content tags includes the following 
elements:  
case: contains grammatical case information giv-
en by a dictionary for a given form 
conjugation: a new tag, contains information 
about the conjugation of the Bulgarian verbs 
def: directly contains the text of the definition 
domain: domain 
eg: a structure, contains an example, as given in 
a dictionary, and allows the tags source and q  
etym: a structure, contains etymological infor-
mation and allows the tags lang and m, as given 
in a dictionary 
gen: identifies the morphological gender of a 
lexical item, as given in the dictionary 
geo: geographic area 
gram: contains grammatical information relating 
to a word other than gender, number, case, per-

44



son, tense, mood, itype, as these all have their 
own element; for example, for aspect – perfect 
aspect (p.) and progressive aspect (i.)  
hw: the headword; used for alphabetization and 
indexing 
itype: indicates the inflectional class associated 
with a lexical item, as given in a dictionary 
lang: language; for use in etymologies (in etym) 
m: indicates a grammatical morpheme in the 
context of etymology 
mood: contains information about the grammati-
cal mood of verbs, as given in a dictionary 
number: indicates grammatical number associ-
ated with a form, as given in a dictionary 
orth: gives the orthographic form of a dictionary 
headword 
person: indicates grammatical person associated 
with a form, as given in a dictionary 
pos: indicates the part of speech assigned to a 
dictionary headword (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) 
q: contains a quotation or apparent quotation 
register: register, for type attribute on usg tag 
semantic: a new tag, containing the active indi-
cation of the verb action (event or state)  
source: bibliographic source for a quotation 
subc: contains sub-categorization information 
(for verbs: transitive/intransitive, for numerals: 
countable/non-count, etc.) 
time: temporal, historical era, for example, “ar-
chaic”, “old”, etc. 
tns: indicates the grammatical tense associated 
with a given inflected form in a dictionary  
trans: new tag contains translation text and re-
lated information, so may contain any of the ba-
setags; the principle is that everything under 
trans relates to the target language 
usg: contains usage information in a dictionary 
entry, other than time, domain, register (as 
these all have their own element), like “dialect”, 
“folk”, “colloquialism”, etc.  
xr: uses to indicate a cross reference with the 
pointer. 

For each group of synonym Polish translations 
of a given Bulgarian word, a corresponding 
structure of type “Sense” is created.  

The Polish translation of Bulgarian headword 
appears in the entry in structures of type "Sense" 
indexing by the numbers of synonymous group 
of translations: 
 
<entry> 
<hw>галe’ри|я</hw> 

... 
<struc type=”Sense” n=”1”> 

<trans>galeria</trans/ 

<gen>f</gen> 
<eg> 
<q>карт’инна ~я</q> 
<trans>galeria obrazów</trans> 
</eg> 

</struc> 
<struc type=”Sense” n=”2”> 

<usg type=”register”>górn.</usg> 
<trans>chodnik</trans/ 
<gen>m</gen> 

</struc> 
</entry> 

3 Digital Presentation of Some Specific 
Features of Bulgarian  

The structure and content tags of the designed 
structural unit should fully meet international 
standards so that the LDB and the electronic dic-
tionaries are compatible with language resources 
created in other projects and for other languages. 

Let us introduce some notation used in the lex-
ical database. The symbol “ ’ ” is used to mark 
the accent of the Bulgarian words, and the sym-
bol “ | ” is used to separate the variable part of 
the word from the main part. 

Structure of a dictionary entry:  
• Headword  
• Formal Features – phonetics, grammar, 

morphology, syntax, etymology, style  
• Semantic information  
• Quotations  
• Additional information:  
1.     Derivatives 
2.     Phrases 
3.     Examples - phrasal and sentence usages, 

illustrations 
Realization of homonyms: 
The meanings of homonyms are entered in the 

dictionary as different database records. On the 
word-entry page, there is a field where the user 
must specify a homonym index - a number which 
shows the order of the meanings. For the repre-
sentation of the homonym it is necessary to fill in 
the value of the attribute n (homonym index) in 
the tag <entry>: 

<entry n=”1”> 
<entry n=”2”> 
Presentation of Bulgarian Verbs: 
As expected, the richest from the viewpoint of 

specific characteristics is the Bulgarian verb. 
Traditional printed dictionaries, however, have 
the shortcoming that not all characteristics are 
coded and presented by respective classifiers 
(Dimitrova et al., 2009a).  

45



To represent the Bulgarian verbs more ade-
quately, in Bulgarian-Polish LDB new content 
tags were added:  

 
• to represent the conjugation of verbs - 

the <conjugation> tag and the <type> tag (for 
the three types of conjugation),  
• to represent semantic information - the 

<semantic> tag and the <type> tag (1 for verbs 
expressing “state” and 2 for verbs expressing 
“event” ).  

New information for the aspect of verbs in the 
tag <gram> (for perfect aspect and progressive 
aspect) is also added. 

The content tag subc that contains sub-
categorization information is very useful for 
presentation of specific information of Bulgarian 
verbs, namely information about their transitiv-
ity/intransitivity. 

The next example shows the presentation of 
the entry with headword повярвам /believe/ in 
paper Bulgarian-Polish dictionary (Sławski, 
1987): 
повя’рва|м, -ш vp. uwierzyć; не мо’га да ~м на 
очи’те си pot. nie mogę uwierzyć swoim oczom, nie 
wierzę swoim oczom  

and corresponding presentation of this headword 
as an entry in Bulgarian-Polish LDB: 
 
<entry> 
  <hw>повя’рва|м</hw>  
<conjugation> 
  <orth>-ш</orth>  
  <type>3</type>  
  </conjugation> 
<semantic> 
  <orth>state</orth>  
  <type>1</type>  
 </semantic> 
 <subc>transitive</subc>  
  <pos>v</pos>  
  <gram>p</gram>  
<struc type="Sense" n="1"> 
  <trans>uwierzyć</trans>  
  </struc> 
<eg> 
  <q>не мо’га да ~м на очи’те си</q>  
  <usg type="register">pot</usg>  
  <trans>nie mogę uwierzyć swoim oczom, nie 
wierzę swoim oczom</trans>  
  </eg> 
</entry> 

4 Relational Database of the Bulgarian-
Polish Online Dictionary  

The lexical database serves as the basis for de-
signing the relational database which is the initial 
point for developing the Bulgarian-Polish online 
dictionary. Its main use is to store and search the 
dictionary entries.  

The model of the relational database (RDB) of 
the Bulgarian-Polish online dictionary is based 
on the validated lexical entries. As the number of 
these lexical entries is limited, it is natural to as-
sume that the relational database is experimental 
and could be improved with the increasing num-
ber of examined lexical entries.  

In the design of the relational database an op-
portunity for translating from Polish to Bulgarian 
language is also provided. That translation will 
be made from the main senses of the Bulgarian 
headwords. The phrases and examples cannot 
provide synonymous meanings, so they will not 
be used for translating from Polish to Bulgarian 
language.  

Therefore, the corresponding data for the Pol-
ish words (examples of usage, phraseology, etc.) 
have to be entered in the empty field in the Pol-
ish-Bulgarian dictionary entry.  

The current model of the relational database is 
represented on Figure 1 and detailed information 
on it can be found in Tables 1 - 6 (see Appen-
dix). 

5 Transformation of the LDB into RDB  
An XML parser is created to transform the lexi-
cal database into the relational database. The aim 
of the syntactic analyzer is to initialize the rela-
tional database, serving as a basis of the diction-
ary. The saved entries in the RDB can then be 
edited trough the administrative module of the 
web-based application of the dictionary. 

The parser implementation uses the DOM 
technology (Document Object Model: 
http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR). With this 
technology the whole document is read and a 
DOM tree is constructed. This tree represents a 
hierarchy of nodes and each node is an object in 
the XML document. A random access to the 
nodes of the DOM tree is possible. All embedded 
tags and attributes of the current node can also be 
accessed at random.  

For that reason the DOM technology is chosen 
instead of the alternative SAX (Simple API for 
XML) technology which cannot process complex 
and embedded searches. The disadvantage of the 
DOM technology is the higher amount of mem-

46



ory required when reading large XML docu-
ments compared to the SAX technology. 

The DOM parser for transforming the LDB of 
the Bulgarian–Polish dictionary into RDB is pro-
grammed in Java. In this way it can be run on 
different platforms independent of the architec-
ture or the operating system. 

6 Online dictionary – Brief Description  

The Bulgarian–Polish online dictionary is real-
ized by the web-based application supporting by 
the Bulgarian-Polish LDB and RDB. This web-
based application is experimental, and the struc-
ture of the text fields is not permanently deter-
mined. 

The implementation of the web-based applica-
tion is based on the following technologies: 
Apache, MySQL, PHP and JavaScript. These are 
free technologies originally designed for devel-
oping dynamic web pages with greater function-
ality.  

The web-based application consists of two 
main software tools: administrator and end-user 
module (Dimitrova et al., 2009b). The adminis-
trator module serves to create the database and 
update the dictionary. Access to the administra-
tive module is restricted to authorized users (so 
called administrators) (Table 7 in Appendix). 
After logging onto the system the administrator 
has possibilities to access the database and to 
enter new entries, headwords, classifications, or 
to edit/delete existing ones. 

The web-based end-user interface is bilingual. 
The user can choose the input language (Bulgar-
ian or Polish) with possibilities to search for 
translation in both directions Bulgarian-to-
Polish, or Polish-to-Bulgarian. The Bulgarian-to-
Polish translation will display the whole informa-
tion existing in the dictionary entry but the oppo-
site translation will be made only from the main 
senses of the Bulgarian headwords (Figure 4).  

Next, an example shows how the Bulgarian 
verb повярвам /believe/ is inserted in the data 
base through the administrative module of the 
web application (Figure 2) (especially the infor-
mation about its transitivity, semantic features 
and conjugation type), and further, how this in-
formation is displayed on the screen to the end-
user (Figure 3). (The Figures 2 – 4 are shown in 
the Appendix.) 

7 Conclusion and Future works 
The paper presents briefly the Bulgarian-Polish 
LDB that supports the first Bulgarian-Polish on-

line dictionary. The dictionary is at an experi-
mental stage and intended for research purposes, 
but it will also be widely applicable to the con-
trastive studies of Bulgarian and Polish, in a sys-
tem for human and machine translation, as well 
as in education. 

Future implementation will include some 
“search” functions with a query, where the 
search parameters are fixed and which as a result 
will extract and show to the user the relevant in-
formation from the Bulgarian-Polish LDB – dic-
tionary entry (entries), for example, to show 
transitive Bulgarian verbs, or Bulgarian adjec-
tives that serve also as adverbs.
