Abstract

The present study describes recent devel-
opments of Chinese Wordnet, which has
been reformatted using the lemon model
and published as part of the Linguistic
Linked Open Data Cloud. While lemon
suffices for modeling most of the struc-
tures in Chinese Wordnet at the lexical
level, the model does not allow for finer-
grained distinction of a word sense, or
meaning facets, a linguistic feature also
attended to in Chinese Wordnet. As for
the representation of synsets, we use the
WordNet RDF ontology for integration’s
sake. Also, we use another ontology pro-
posed by the Global WordNet Association
to show how Chinese Wordnet as Linked
Data can be integrated into the Global
WordNet Grid.

1 Introduction

Although the rationale underlying synsets remains
disputable (Maziarz et al., 2013), the practical
value of wordnet as lexical resource is undeni-
able, particularly that of the first and foremost of
its kind, Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum,
1998). According to a search run by Morato et
al. (Morato et al., 2004) on some major biblio-
graphic databases like LISA, INSPEC and IEEE,
the decade between 1994 and 2003 saw a wide
range of wordnet applications, including concep-
tual disambiguation, information retrieval, query
expansion and machine translation, among others.
At present, more than another decade after the sur-
vey, wordnets not only continue to assist in a va-
riety of NLP tasks, but plays an important role
in shaping the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee et al.,
2001) along with other major language resources
(De Melo, 2008).

Central to the practice of the Semantic Web
is the use of Linked Data to harmonize and in-

terlink resources and datasets on the Web. This
idea has found its way into the world of linguis-
tics and led to the emergence of the Linguistic
Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud (Chiarcos et al.,
2011). Among the models available for lexicon
representation, the lemon model (McCrae et al.,
2012) is chosen. In adopting lemon, we intend not
only to render Chinese Wordnet more accessible
as Linked Data, but also to examine to what extent
the model can express linguistic features peculiar
to Chinese languages. On the other hand, we rep-
resent synsets using the WordNet RDF ontology
designed by Princeton for use in the context of
lemon. Finally, another ontology consisting of 71
Base Types proposed by the Global WordNet As-
sociation is used to illustrate how in the long run
Chinese Wordnet can be integrated into the Global
WordNet Grid (Pease et al., 2008).

2 Chinese Wordnet

Chinese Wordnet (CWN) is a lexical-conceptual
network for Mandarin Chinese, its contents struc-
tured along the same lines of PWN. First con-
structed based on translational equivalents of
PWN mapped to Suggested Upper Merged Ontol-
ogy (Huang et al., 2004), CWN has been recon-
structed from scratch in 2014 and released with an
open-source license. As with most wordnets CWN
provides knowledge about lexicalized concepts,
including their representing lexical item’s part-of-
speech, definition, and a set of other lexicalized
concepts with which they form a synset. To date,
CWN contains more than 28,000 word-sense pairs
that are organized in some 20,000 synsets. In addi-
tion to the synonymy implicitly present in synsets,
CWN includes other lexical-semantic relations to
connect the lexicalized concepts, meronomy and
hypernymy-hyponymy in particular.

What distinguishes CWN from its counterparts
for other languages are primarily the distinction of
meaning facets (Ahrens et al., 1998; Hsieh, 2011)

70



and a newly conceived type of relation termed
paranymy (Huang et al., 2007). However, it is to
be revealed that the current design of lemon does
not allow for the representation of meaning facets
and that the vocabulary of WordNet RDF ontology
does not include paranymy.

3 Converting CWN into Linked Data
with lemon

To improve its interoperability with other lexical
resources, CWN is converted in RDF format using
the lemon model. The following subsections pro-
vide a general introduction to lemon and Linked
Data, followed by a discussion of the idiosyn-
crasies of Mandarin (as reflected in CWN) to be
considered for a thorough conversion to a linked,
lemonized version of CWN.

3.1 The lemon Model and CWN
lemon (McCrae et al., 2011) is an ontology-
lexicon model for representing lexical resources
whose semantics is given by an external ontology.
Following the principle of semantics by reference
(Buitelaar, 2010), the model is meant to allow for
linguistic grounding of a given ontology via sup-
plementing the ontology with information about
how the elements in the ontology’s vocabulary are
lexicalized in a given natural language. With the
lexical and semantic layers separated as such, the
same lemon-based lexicon can describe elements
belonging to different ontologies; conversely, the
same ontology can describe the semantics of all
lexical resources in lemon format. As shown in
Figure 1, the core of lemon includes:

Figure 1: Core modules of the lemon model.
(Taken from http://lemon-model.net/.)

• a lexical entry, which represents a single
word or multi-word unit,

• a lexical sense, which represents the usage of
a word as a reference to a concept in the on-
tology, and

• forms, which are inflected versions of the lex-
ical entry, and associated with a string repre-
sentation.

While lemon has proven adequate for model-
ing well-documented languages as those found
in major lexical resources like PWN (McCrae et
al., 2014) and Open Multilingual Wordnet (Bond
and Foster, 2013), it remains to be seen whether
the model is comprehensive enough for describ-
ing less privileged languages too. For instance,
it is claimed that “the morphology module of
lemon may serve less for Bantu languages lex-
ica” (Chavula and Keet, 2014). In our case, while
lemon suffices for modeling most of the struc-
tures in Chinese Wordnet at the lexical level, it
does not allow for the representation of meaning
facets. Consider the different uses of the lemma
shu1 “book” in the following sentences adapted
from Bond et al. (2014):

(1) bang1
help

wo3
me

na2
take

na4
that

ben3
CL

shu1
book

‘Pass me that book.’

(2) ta1
he

zai4
PROG

du2
read

na4
that

ben3
CL

shu1
book

‘He is reading that book.’

(3) na2
take

yi4
one

ben3
CL

shu1
book

gei3
give

wo3
me

kan3
read

‘Pass me a book to read.’

The same lemma shu1 “book” refers to a physical
object in (1) but to the information contained in
(2). While the two readings may be referred to
as different word senses, there exist contexts that
allow the co-existence of both readings, as in (3),
where the lemma can be interpreted as a physical
object as well as the information contained in that
object. Meaning distinction as such is therefore
considered a facet rather than a sense.

Within the lemon model, however, there is no
module for modeling meaning facets as there are
for representing word forms and word senses. As a
result, as many as 6,000 meaning facets identified
in Chinese Wordnet cannot be published as part of
the Linked Data for the time being.

71



3.2 Linked Data and Chinese Languages
Linked Data refers to data accessible on the Web
and compiled such that it is machine-readable, its
meaning is defined explicitly, and it is interlinked
with other external data sets. Berners-Lee (2006)
provides a set of guidelines for publishing Linked
Data:

1. Use URIs as names for things.

2. Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up
those names.

3. When someone looks up a URI, provide use-
ful information, using the standards (RDF,
SPARQL).

4. Include links to other URIs, so that they can
discover more things.

Straightforward as the instructions may seem,
the first rule regarding URI-naming already poses
problems for languages whose writing system is
not the Latin alphabet. Consider the URI scheme
for identifying lemmas of a specific part-of-speech
in the online RDF version of WordNet by Prince-
ton1:

http:// . . ./wn31/ {lemma}-{pos}

If CWN adopts the same scheme and fills in the
lemma slot with Chinese characters and specifies
a lexical category, URIs as such will be generated:

http:// . . ./cwn/lod/ ^̂̂ÓÓÓ-n

While multilingual addresses are well supported
in modern web browsers, such URIs mean little to
non-Chinese reading users and can hinder other re-
source providers from mapping CWN entries with
their own. Another solution is to romanize the
characters and number their tones:

http:// . . ./cwn/lod/ ci2mu4-n

Due to the prevalence of homophones in Chi-
nese, however, the alternative leads to another is-
sue: there exist many heterographs distinguishable
only by their logographic representations when no
context is given. A romanized form like ci2mu4
can be interpreted nominally as “shrine-tomb” (`
ì) or “Ibaraki city” ((() as well as “lemma”
(^Ó). As a result, the design of such URI scheme

1http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/

is not effective in identifying a specific lexical en-
try, at least not for Chinese.2 On the other hand,
the RDF version of WordNet found in lemonUby3

points to lemmas using the following URI scheme:

http:// . . ./WN_LexicalEntry_ {id}

By contrast, lemonUby makes use of unique IDs in
combination with the prefix WN LexicalEntry to
ensure one-to-one correspondence between URIs
and lexical entries. Truly unique lemma identi-
fiers are derived as such, even though the scheme
observes the first rule for serving Linked Data only
loosely, in the sense that with the prefix as the sole
meaningful component part and without a lexical
form embedded in the URI, the naming does not
shed much light on the entry being linked to.

To uniquely identify lemmas without trading off
URI readability on the part of the end user, CWN
points to lemma entries using both a romanized
lexical form and a unique ID. Take for example
the following URI:

http:// . . ./cwn/lod/ ai4 / 067081

While the ID 067081 alone suffices to pinpoint its
associated lexical entry, ai4 “love” helps indicate
the phonetic form of the lemma being referred to.
When the trailing ID is not specified, however, all
the entries with the romanization ai4 will be listed
along with their respective IDs. The optionality of
the ID component part enables the user (or agent)
to begin a query with a romanized form and then
narrow it down to a specific lexical entry. More-
over, the path to a lemma can be further appended
by a hash tag and a number to point to one sense of
the lemma.4 As for URIs of synsets, since a synset
typically contains more than one sense and there-
fore cannot be represented with one single lexical
form, CWN uses only IDs to identify a synset, as
the RDF version of WordNet does in lemonUby.

While the first two rules address the scheme and
the type of URIs to be used, the last two concern
the contents to be served when a URL is derefer-
enced. In adopting the RDF-native lemon model,

2Note that the same situation is observed with URIs
embedded with lexical forms of alphabetic languages
when homophony occurs. For example, The URL http:
//wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn31/bank-n
points to both “river bank” and “financial bank” in PWN.

3http://lemon-model.net/lexica/uby/wn/
4Fore example, http://lope.linguistics.

ntu.edu.tw/cwn/lod/biao3/041141#11 points to
the eleventh sense of the lemma biao3 “show”.

72



CWN meets the third rule of using standard for-
mats at the outset. As for the fourth rule that re-
quires the inclusion of other URIs, links to PWN’s
synsets are included that correspond to those of
CWN. This last rule is to be addressed in more de-
tail in Section 4.

3.3 CWN as Linked Data
Chief among the threads of information to be con-
verted in RDF are the word senses and synsets
of CWN. While the former correspond readily to
lemon’s lexical senses, their lemmas to lemon’s
lexical entries, the latter require special treatment.
To comply with the aforementioned principle of
separating linguistic realizations from underlying
concepts, synsets are regarded as ontological ref-
erences with which word senses are associated.
Using the WordNet RDF ontology5 introduced
by McCrae et al.(2014) for use in the context of
lemon, we represent CWN’s synsets as a subclass
of Concept in SKOS (Miles and Pérez-Agüera,
2007), expressing synsets without describing them
with a formal ontological type. Figure 2 depicts
a lemon representation of the first sense of the
lemma dong4wu4 “animal” in Turtle format.6

In the WordNet RDF ontology, however, there is
no vocabulary for describing the relation between
coordinate terms that share the same classificatory
criteria, or paranymy. Take season (of the year)
for example. Except when referring to a tropi-
cal climate, a first impression about the term is
oftentimes the categorization of spring, summer,
fall and winter. Other terms such as dry season
and rainy season are not thought of as parallel as
the four seasons, even though all of them share the
same immediate superordinate concept (Huang et
al., 2008). While CWN attends to this syntagmatic
relation between different groupings of hyponyms,
it can only be expressed when PWN adopts this
type of relation or when a tailor-made ontology for
lemon-CWN is in place.

4 Interlinking lemon-CWN on the Web

As shown in Figure 2, there can be an outward
link to PWN if the synset referenced by a lexical
sense has a comparable entry in PWN. By way of
synset mapping, lemon-CWN is not only linked
to PWN, but also indirectly interlinked with other
wordnets via PWN. Besides using PWN as key to
the LLOD cloud and interface with other linguistic
resources, lemon-CWN can be integrated into the
Global WordNet Grid when organized, along with
other wordnets, by the ontology consisting of 71
Base Types proposed by the Global WordNet As-
sociation.7 An initial mapping has identified 169
synsets comparable to the Base Types.8

5 Conclusion

We have described a lemonized version of CWN
to be integrated in the LLOD cloud and the Global
WordNet Grid. In converting CWN into Linked
Data, we have established a URI scheme optimal
for encoding Chinese lemmas alternatively written
in the Latin alphabet. Also, we have pointed out
two aspects of CWN that cannot be expressed us-
ing lemon and the WordNet RDF ontology, respec-
tively the unit of meaning facets and the relation
of paranymy. Future work thus includes finding
another model that allows for the representation
of meaning facets and designing an ontology for
lemon-CWN that has vocabulary for paranymy.
