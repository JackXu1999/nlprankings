ABSTRACT
Studies have shown that modern methods of readability assessment, using automated linguistic
analysis and machine learning (ML), is a viable road forward for readability classification and
ranking. In this paper we present a study of different levels of analysis and a large number of
features and how they affect an ML-system’s accuracy when it comes to readability assessment.
We test a large number of features proposed for different languages (mainly English) and
evaluate their usefulness for readability assessment for Swedish as well as comparing their
performance to that of established metrics. We find that the best performing features are
language models based on part-of-speech and dependency type.

1 Introduction

The problem of readability assessment is the problem of mapping from a text to some unit
representing the text’s degree of readability. Measures of readability are mostly used to inform
a reader how difficult a text is to read, either to give them a hint that they may try to find
an easier to read text on the same topic or simply to inform them that a text may take some
time to comprehend. Readability measures are mainly used to inform persons with reading
disabilities on the complexity of a text, but can also be used to, for instance, assist teachers
with assessing the reading ability of a student. By measuring the reading abilities of a person, it
might also be possible to automatically find texts that fits that persons reading ability. It has
further been shown that readability is a useful measure for finding a corpus for training vector
space models (Smith et al., 2012).

Readability gives rise to a number of problems. For instance, readability is not a function of text
only but a function of both text and reader, as defined by Dale and Chall (1949): "[Readability
is] the sum total (including all the interactions) of all those elements within a given piece of
printed material that affect the success a group of readers have with it. The success is the extent
to which they understand it, read it at optimal speed, and find it interesting." However, in this
study we make the assumption that a function of text only can be a useful approximation. This
assumption is supported by and related to the practice of American researchers to normalize
their metrics to the U.S. grade level. Resources for such a normalisation for Swedish are not
yet readily available and until they are we focus on the problem of classifying texts as either
easy-to-read or not.

Readability assessment has been a field of interest for linguists since the 1920s but intensive
research begun in the U.S. in the late 1940s (Sjöholm, 2012). This research resulted in the
introduction of the first version of the Flesch Reading Ease test (Flesch, 1948) and the Dale-Chall
formula, versions of which are still used today.

A number of easily calculated readability metrics (consisting of a small number of easily counted
features such as average word length, lexical variation and frequency of "simple words") were
introduced for English during the following three decades. Some examples are the Coleman-
Liau index, which was specifically designed for automated assessment of readability (Coleman
and Liau, 1975), the SMOG formula (McLaughlin, 1969) and the Fry readability formula (Fry,
1968). All of these metrics were designed to output a score corresponding to the U.S. grade
level thought necessary for full comprehension of a text. In 1975 the Flesch Reading Ease test
was reinvented as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level with the same principle in mind (Kincaid
et al., 1975).

This way of constructing readability metrics was widely accepted as good enough for a long
time. However, in the 1980’s research questioning the performance of these traditional metrics
was being published (Davison and Kantor, 1982).

Readability assessment for Swedish has mostly been done using metrics similar to the ones
constructed for English. The most utilized readability metric for Swedish is LIX, Läsbarhetsindex
(Readability index) (Björnsson, 1968), which is formulated in a way similar to that of the
Flesch metric. Today the LIX metric is basically the standard metric for readability in Swedish.
However, in recent years new research has shown that the metric is not always sufficient
(Mühlenbock and Johansson Kokkinakis, 2009; Heimann Mühlenbock, 2013).

The OVIX Ordvariationsindex (Word variation index) and Nominal Ratio metrics (Hultman
Proceedings of the 19th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2013); Linköping Electronic Conference Proceedings #85 [page 28 of 474]



and Westman, 1977) have been used in research to complement LIX as they are assumed to
correlate with degree of readability viewed from other linguistic levels.

Since the early 2000s the speed and accuracy of text analysis tools such as lemmatizers, part-
of-speech taggers and syntax parsers have made new text features available for readability
assessment. By using machine learning a number of researchers have devised innovative ways
of assessing readability. For instance, phrase grammar parsing has been used to find the average
number of sub-clauses, verb phrases, noun phrases and average tree depth (Schwarm and
Ostendorf, 2005).

The use of language models to assess the degree of readability was also introduced in the early
2000s (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004) and later combined with classification algorithms
such as support vector machines to further increase accuracy (Petersen, 2007; Feng, 2010)

In this paper we present a study on the problem of finding and evaluating features relevant for
classification. Such classifiers have previously been experimented with for Italian (Dell’Orletta
et al., 2011). An extension of such a classifier has been proposed as an alternative to regression
or detectors when it comes to ordering documents based on degree of readability (Falkenjack
and Heimann Mühlenbock, 2012). The present approach is experimental in the sense that
several feature models, simple as well as complex, are tested and compared. The models are
based on text properties acting at various language levels, and the task is to identify the best-
performing feature model for readability assessment viewed from one or several specific aspects
of written language. An even more complex model where also the semantic aspect is taken into
account would demand language resources supplied with information on concepts and meaning
as for instance WordNet (Miller, 1995). Such an approach is presented in Heimann Mühlenbock
(2013), where readability is regarded as the totality of features acting at five different levels of
language representation, including the idea density level.

2 Study

In the study presented in this paper we evaluate a number of models for readability on a variety
of corpora to assess the models’ ability to classify a text as easy-to-read or not.

2.1 Corpora

To train and test our classifier we use one easy-to-read corpus and five corpora representing
ordinary language in different text genres. The latter corpora will further on be labeled as
non-easy-to-read. For each category we use 700 texts.

Our source of easy-to-read material is the LäSBarT corpus (Mühlenbock, 2008). LäSBarT
consists of manually created easy-to-read texts from a variety of sources and genres.

The non-easy-to-read material comprise texts from a variety of corpora to make sure that
what we are classifying is readability rather than genre. This material consists of 215 articles
from GP2007 (news text), 34 whole issues of Forskning och Framsteg (popular science), 214
articles from Läkartidningen 05 (professional news), 214 public information notices from
Smittskyddsinstitutet (government text) and 23 full novels from the Norstedts publishing house
(fiction).

By using a corpus with such a variety of documents we will get texts that have different degree
of readability which is important as we want to be able to use the same model on all types of
text.

The texts are preprocessed using the Korp corpus import tool (Borin et al., 2012). Steps in
the preprocessing chain relevant for this study are tokenization, lemmatisation, part-of-speech
tagging and dependency grammar parsing. The Korp tool is publicly available for testing.

2.2 Classification

We use the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) suite and its implementation
of the popular classification algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM). Support Vector Machines
has been increasingly popular in Computational Linguistics in recent years and have, among
other uses, been used for readability assessment with good results (Petersen, 2007; Feng, 2010).

The SVM algorithm is an algebraic approach to the classification problem. Objects with a known
class are represented as points in an n-dimensional space, where n is the number of attributes.
An algorithm then attempts to find a maximum margin hyperplane separating the objects by
their class (Witten et al., 2011). New objects are classified by calculating on which side of this
hyperplane the object’s corresponding point occurs.

The version of SVM-learning (finding the separating hyperplane) we use is the SMO, Sequential
Minimal Optimization, algorithm (Platt, 1998). A Java implementation of a SMO-based SVM is
included in the standard Weka toolkit.

We chose the SVM-approach as prior research has shown that it is one of the best performing
algorithms for degree of readability classification using the full set, or subsets, of features we
evaluate in this study (Sjöholm, 2012).

2.3 Models

We have constructed a total of 34 models. First we have three models representing the
established Swedish metrics used to measure, or assumed to correlate with some aspect of
readability, namely LIX, OVIX and Nominal ratio (NR).

We also use 21 single feature models. These models represent features proposed for readability
assessment in prior research, mainly on English texts. As the primary aim of this study is to
evaluate these feature models’ ability to predict readability these models are the most important.

As many of the single feature models result from the same kind of preprocessing, we have
also decided to create ten compound models. We divide the features into four levels similar
to the four levels used by the READ-IT system for Italian (Dell’Orletta et al., 2011). These
levels are Shallow (requires tokenization), Lexical (requires lemmatisation), morpho-syntactic
(requires part-of-speech tagging) and Syntactic (requires parsing, in our case with a dependency
grammar parser).

Seven models based on these levels are constructed, four which covers only a single level each;
Shallow, Lexical, Morpho and Syntactic. Three models incrementally add levels to the analysis;
the LexicalInc model which consists of all features from the Lexical and Shallow models, the
MorphoInc model which consists of all features from the LexicalInc and Morpho models and the
SyntacticInc model which consists of all features from the MorphoInc and the Syntactic models.
These models are used to evaluate to what degree each level of linguistic analysis improves our
model’s ability to predict readability.

We also create three models combining the established metrics, LIX, OVIX and NR. The first,
called TradComb, comprise only the three established metrics. The other two combine TradComb

Proceedings of the 19th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2013); Linköping Electronic Conference Proceedings #85 [page 30 of 474]



with SyntacticInc (Total) and MorphoInc (NoDep) respectively.

2.3.1 Shallow features

The shallow text features are the main features traditionally used for simple readability metrics.
They occur in the "shallow" surface structure of the text and can be extracted after tokenization
by simply counting words and characters. They include:

AvgWordLengthChars Average word length calculated as the average number of characters
per word.

AvgWordLengthSylls Average word length calculated as the average number of syllables per
word. The number of syllables is approximated by counting the number of vowels.

AvgSentLength Average sentence length calculated as the average number of words per
sentence.

Longer sentences, as well as longer words, tend to predict a more difficult text as exemplified
by the performance of the LIX metric and related metrics for English. These types of features
have been used in a number of readability studies based on machine learning (Feng, 2010) and
as baseline when evaluating new features (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008).

2.3.2 Lexical features

Our lexical features are based on categorical word frequencies. The word frequencies are
extracted after lemmatization and are calculated using the basic Swedish vocabulary SweVoc
(Heimann Mühlenbock, 2013). SweVoc is comparable to the list used in the classic Dale-Chall
formula (Dale and Chall, 1949) for English and developed for similar purposes, however special
sub-categories have been added (of which three are specifically considered). The following
frequencies are calculated, based on different categories in SweVoc:

SweVocC SweVoc lemmas fundamental for communication (category C).

SweVocD SweVoc lemmas for everyday use (category D).

SweVocH SweVoc other highly frequent lemmas (category H).

SweVocTotal Unique, per lemma, SweVoc words (all categories, including some not mentioned
above) per sentence.

A high ratio of SweVoc words should indicate a more easy-to-read text. The Dale-Chall metric
(Chall and Dale, 1995) has been used as a similar feature in a number of machine learning
based studies of text readability for English (Feng, 2010; Pitler and Nenkova, 2008). The
SweVoc metrics are also related to the language model features used in a number of studies
(Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005; Heilman et al., 2008).

2.3.3 Morpho-syntactic features

The morpho-syntactic features concern a morphology based analysis of text. For the purposes of
this study the analysis relies on previously part-of-speech annotated text, which is investigated
with regard to the following features:

UnigramPOS Unigram probabilities for 26 different parts-of-speech in the document, that is,
the ratio of each part-of-speech, on a per token basis, as individual attributes. Such a
unigram language model based on part-of-speech, and similar metrics, has shown to be a
relevant feature for readability assessment for English (Heilman et al., 2007; Petersen,
2007; Dell’Orletta et al., 2011).

RatioContent The ratio of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), on a per
token basis, in the text. Such a metric has been used in a number of related studies
(Alusio et al., 2010).

2.3.4 Syntactic features

These features are estimable after syntactic parsing of the text. The syntactic feature set is
extracted after dependency parsing using the Maltparser (Nivre et al., 2006). Such parsers
has been used for preprocessing texts for readability assessment for Italian (Dell’Orletta et al.,
2011). The dependency based features consist of:

AvgDepDistDep The average dependency distance in the document on a per dependent basis.
A longer average dependency distance could indicate a more complex text (Liu, 2008).

AvgDepDistSent The average dependency distance in the document on a per sentence basis. A
longer average total dependency distance per sentence could indicate a more complex
text (Liu, 2008).

RightDeps The ratio of right dependencies to total number of dependencies in the document.
A high ratio of right dependencies could indicate a more complex text.

SentenceDepth The average sentence depth. Sentences with deeper dependency trees could
be indicative of a more complex text in the same way as phrase grammar trees has been
shown to be (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009).

UnigramDepType Unigram probabilities for the 63 dependency types resulting from the depen-
dency parsing, on a per token basis. These features are comparable to the part-of-speech
unigram probabilities and to the phrase type rate based on phrase grammar parsing used
in earlier research (Nenkova et al., 2010).

VerbalRoots The ratio of sentences with a verbal root, that is, the ratio of sentences where the
root word is a verb to the total number of sentences (Dell’Orletta et al., 2011).

AvgVerbArity The average arity of verbs in the document, calculated as the average number of
dependents per verb (Dell’Orletta et al., 2011).

UnigramVerbArity The ratios of verbs with an arity of 0-7 as distinct features (Dell’Orletta
et al., 2011).
Proceedings of the 19th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2013); Linköping Electronic Conference Proceedings #85 [page 32 of 474]



We also propose the following four syntactic features:

TokensPerClause The average number of tokens per clause in the document. This is related to
the shallow feature average number of tokens per sentence.

PreModifiers The average number of nominal pre-modifiers per sentence.

PostModifiers The average number of nominal post-modifiers per sentence.

PrepComp The average number of prepositional complements per sentence in the document.

2.4 Evaluation

We evaluated the 21 single feature models presented above, three traditional metric models
and the ten compound models presented above. Some features, rendered in italics in Table 2,
consist of more than one concrete attribute and a few attributes are considered both as features
in themselves and as attributes in larger feature models.

To test our models we use 7-fold cross validation over a set of 1400 documents. Each chunk
consists of 100 easy-to-read texts and 100 non-easy-to-read texts. The corpora used to make
up the non-easy-to-read set are shuffled and might therefore not be evenly distributed among
the chunks (if this is a problem it should show up as a generally high standard deviation for all
accuracies).

The result of the evaluation represents each model’s ability to correctly identify easy-to-read
texts. The accuracy of a model represents the proportion of the documents which are correctly
classified as either easy-to-read or non-easy-to-read. A higher accuracy implies that the model,
and its underlying features, more strongly predict degree of readability. To complement the
accuracy we also provide precision and recall for the sets of easy-to-read texts and non-easy-
to-read texts respectively, this to better understand where low performing models might go
wrong.

In addition we present the standard deviation for each percentage based on the 7 folds of the
cross validation. A high standard deviation implies inconsistent performance.

3 Results and discussion

The results of our test runs are presented below. We present the average values for the 7-fold
cross validation in percent as well as the standard deviation in percentage points.

3.1 Traditional metrics

Among the traditional metrics (see Table 1) OVIX actually seems to perform about as well as
LIX. This is somewhat surprising as LIX is designed to directly measure readability while OVIX
is only assumed to indirectly measure readability. As OVIX considers totally different features
from LIX, it does, perhaps, strengthen the point that LIX, as the standard readability metric for
Swedish, might be overly simplistic.

Nominal ratio, NR, is the worst performing of the traditional metrics. It seems that the NR
model tend to over-classify documents as easy to read, demonstrated by high recall but low
precision for LäSBarT. As NR and ratio of content words, RatioContent, (see Table 2) both

Table 1: Performance of the three traditional metrics. The accuracy represents the average
percentage of texts classified correctly, with the standard deviation within parentheses. Precision
and Recall are also provided, with standard deviations within parenthesis, for both easy-to-read
(LäSBarT) and non-easy-to-read (Other) sets.

LIX 84.6 (1.9) 87.9 (2.9) 80.4 (2.8) 82.0 (2.1) 88.9 (3.0)
OVIX 85.6 (2.3) 86.8 (4.3) 84.4 (3.1) 84.9 (2.4) 86.9 (5.0)
NR 55.3 (9.1) 53.5 (6.8) 99.1 (1.9) 96.0 (7.7) 11.4 (20.1)

perform badly, it seems that only a more complex part-of-speech based feature, such as the
multi-attribute feature consisting of unigrams for all POS-types is sufficient. Further analysis of
single POS-type models might yield interesting results though.

3.2 Single feature models

Looking at Table 2 we see that most single feature models provide some indication on degree of
text readability. There are however some models which perform a lot worse than anticipated.

It seems that the average dependency distance per sentence, AvgDepDistSent, is more or less
useless, it might be that this is nothing more than a convoluted way to talk about sentence
length, AvgSentLength, which in itself appears to be a highly inconsistent feature. Both these
metrics over-classify documents as easy-to-read to a very high degree.

Also surprising is that the ratio of content words, RatioContent, does not seem to be a good
indicator of readability. However, this does not seem to be a problem of over-classification,
rather the model seems to be equally bad at classifying both sets, based on precision and recall
close to 50 % for both sets. It might be that a high ratio of content words indicate a higher
information density and therefore a more complex text while at the same time a low ratio might
instead indicate a syntactically complex text. In such cases a simple SVM classification is not
sufficient. Also, for an inflecting language like Swedish, the ratio of content words might yield
different results than for languages with a more modest morphology, as for instance English. As
with the nominal ratio metric, a closer inspection of single POS-type ratios might yield some
further clues.

The average number of tokens per clause, TokensPerClause, and the ratio of nominal post-
modifiers also seem to have a tendency to over-classify documents as easy-to-read having high
LäSBarT recall but relatively low precision. Nominal pre-modifiers, however, while still suffering
from slight easy-to-read over-classification, perform almost as well as LIX or OVIX when only
accuracy is considered.

Best performing of the single feature models are the unigram models for part-of-speech,
UnigramPOS, and dependency type, UnigramDepType. This is not surprising as these features
represent simple language models and language models are often very powerful when compared
to single attribute features.

It is only the unigram language models, UnigramPOS and UnigramDepType, and the average

dependency distance per dependency, AvgDepDistDep, that outperform the traditional metrics
OVIX and LIX. However, the average number of prepositional complements per sentence,
PrepComp, and nominal pre-modifiers per sentence, PreModifiers, respectively do come close.

3.3 Compound models

When we look at the compound models, Table 3 we can see highly improved performance. Not
surprisingly, we get the best performance from the Total model consisting of all features that
the system is able to extract.

All compound metrics except for the Shallow and Lexical models outperform the traditional
metrics. However, combining these two, the LexicalInc model, does outperform the traditional
metrics LIX, OVIX and NR.

Interestingly the UnigramPOS feature model seems to perform slightly better than the Morpho
model (which actually consists of UnigramPOS and RatioContent). The bad performance of the
ratio of content words model, RatioContent, might introduce some performance-decreasing

confusion though.

The Morpho and Syntactic models both more or less equal the UnigramPOS and UnigramDep-
Type models respectively implying that these are by far the most important features in the
respective models.

4 Conclusions

In this study we have presented a large number of feature models proposed for readability
assessment. Most of these models have previously been shown to be useful for assessing
readability of English texts. Our results show that many of them are also relevant for Swedish,
however some models are less relevant, most notably the ratio of content words, RatioContent,
for which we have no simple explanation. Contrary to, for instance, NR which erroneously
classify many texts as readable and consequentially achieves avery low accuracy, RatioContent
does not have a high recall on any category in the corpora.

The best performing features seem to be part-of-speech or dependency type based language
models, especially the compound models that require parsing using a dependency parser;
Syntactic, SyntacticInc and Total. These models all have high Accuracy, more than 98% and a
fairly low standard deviation showing a stable performance.

We also show that a combination of the three established metrics outperform the standard LIX
metric but also that the use of the raw data necessary to calculate those metrics (the data in
the MorphoInc model) might possibly be put to even better use. Dependency grammar parsing
seems to provide very useful data for identifying easy-to-read texts but in an environment
where such heavy calculations are infeasible a very good result might be found without it as
demonstrated by the NoDep model.

We propose that future research look further into the language models represented by the
UnigramPOS and UnigramDepType models. It might be possible to construct relatively simple

metrics based on only a few of the attributes in these models. It might also be possible to
construct even better performing models by looking at bigrams or trigrams instead of just
unigrams.
