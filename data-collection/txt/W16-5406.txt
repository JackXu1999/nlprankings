Abstract

Paratactic syntactic structures are difficult to represent in syntactic dependency tree structures.
As such, we propose an annotation schema for syntactic dependency annotation of Japanese, in
which coordinate structures are separated from and overlaid on bunsetsu(base phrase unit)-based
dependency. The schema represents nested coordinate structures, non-constituent conjuncts, and
forward sharing as the set of regions. The annotation was performed on the core data of ‘Balanced
Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese’, which comprised about one million words and 1980
samples from six registers, such as newspapers, books, magazines, and web texts.

1 Introduction

Researchers have focused much attention on syntactic dependency parsing, as evidenced in the develop-
ment of treebanks of many languages and dependency parsers on these treebanks. Most of the developed
dependency treebanks have been word-based. However, treebanking based on bunsetsu (base phrase
unit) has been adopted by the Japanese NLP community, due to the nature of the Japanese bunsetsu
dependency structure, such as strictly being head-final and projective on the bunsetsu units.

Several annotation schemas for the bunsetsu-based treebanks are accessible in selected Japanese cor-
pora. First is the Kyoto Text Corpus Schema(hereafter

� �
KC� �)(Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998), which is

used for newspaper articles. Second is the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (Maekawa, 2003) Schema
(hereafter

� �
CSJ� �)(Uchimoto et al., 2006).

We propose a novel annotation schema for the Japanese bunsetsu dependency structure, in which we
also annotate coordinate and apposition structure scopes as segments. In this standard, we define the
detailed inter-clause attachment guideline based on (Minami, 1974) and also introduce some labels to
resolve errors or discrepancies in the upper process of bunsetsu and sentence boundary annotation.

We applied the annotation schema for the core data of ‘Balanced Corpus of Contempo-
rary Written Japanese’ (Maekawa et al., 2014) which comprised data from newspaper(PN),
books(PB),magazines(PM), white paper(OW), Yahoo! Answers(OC), and Yahoo! Blogs(OY). The core
data includes 1.2 million words. We manually checked the annotation three times in seven years. This an-
notation schema is, thus, named BCCWJ-dependency parallel structure annotation (hereafter

� �
BCCWJ� �).

Contributions of the paper are summarised in the following:

• We developed a one-million-word bunsetsu-based dependency annotations on a balanced corpus
that is comprised of newspaper, books, magazines, whitepapers, and web texts.

• We introduced a new annotation schema for coordinate structures and appositions.
• We defined inter-clause attachments by the clause type.
• We resolved the errors of the upper process (word-segmentation and POS tagging layer) in the

annotation schema, such as bunsetsu and sentence boundaries.

In this article, we focus on the annotation schema of coordination and apposition structures in the
dependency treebank. Section 2 presents an overview of the annotation schema. Section 3 describes
the details of the annotation schema on the coordination and apposition structures. Section 4 shows the
inter-clause attachment annotation schema. Section 5 illustrates the basic statistics of the annotation data.
Section 6 discusses the conclusion of this article.

We present the overview of the annotation schema of the
� �
BCCWJ� �by establishing a comparison with

two other linguistics annotation schemas using bunsetsu-based dependency structure. Table 1 illustrates
the comparative differences of the

� �
BCCWJ� �annotation schema from those in the � �KC� �and � �CSJ� �.

The
� �
BCCWJ� �schema defines four labels on the dependency relations: ‘D’ for normal dependency

relation, ‘B’ for the concatenation to make a longer bunsetsu, ‘F’ for no dependency relation, and ‘Z’
marks the end of sentence (EOS).

We introduce ‘segment’ and ‘group’ to express coordination and apposition structures: Figure 1
demonstrates examples of these expressions. Segment is a region of the subsequence of words in the
sentences. Group is a set of segments. Group is used for equivalence class by equivalance relations such
as coordinate structures and coreference relations.

In the first example, the rounded corner squares are the conjuncts of a coordinate structure defined by
the group ‘Parallel’. The conjuncts are defined by the short unit word sequences in the

� �
BCCWJ� �, which

50



is the smallest morpheme unit in the corpus. Therefore, the conjunct boundary can be defined within a
bunsetsu. In that case, the hyphenation is used to indicate NOT bunsetsu boundary. As illustrated in the
second example in Figure 1, the dotted rounded corner squares represent the conjuncts of an appositional
structure in the narrow sense defined by the group ‘Apposition’. We also define other segment and group
in ‘Generic’, which stands for an apposition structure in the broad sense.

Figure 1: The assignment of ‘segment’ and ‘group’ to express coordinate and apposition structure

First, we present the differences of coordination and apposition structures among the annotation stan-
dards. In the

� �
KC� �standard, the label ‘P’ is defined for coordinate structure relation, and the label ‘A’ is

defined for apposition structure relation. For non-constituent conjuncts, the label ‘I’ is used to avoid non-
projective arcs in the dependency structure. The

� �
CSJ� �standard is based on � �KC� �, but it further defined

apposition structures. The
� �
CSJ� �divide the apposition structure into a narrow sense with label ‘A’ and a

broad sense with the label ‘A2’: The label ‘A2’ represents the generic name for the part-of relation or the
numerical expression for the attribute-value relation in an apposition structure. In the

� �
BCCWJ� �standard,

we avoid expressing coordination and apposition structures by their dependency relation, because these
structures in dependency would make the dependency tree structure skewed. As presented above, we
assign ‘segment’ and ‘group’ to each of the labels, namely, ‘Parallel’, ‘Apposition’, and ‘Generic’. The
subsequent section 3 provides in-depth explanation on this.

Second, we present the labels for the case to violate the projective or strictly head final constraints.
The

� �
KC� �standard does not define special labels for such violation, because � �KC� �analyses texts that

are derived from newspaper articles; therefore the dependency structures do not tend to violate these
constraints. In the

� �
CSJ� �standard, the label ‘X’ is defined for the inversion of a non-projective arc,

whereas the label ‘R’ represents the relation from right to left. In the
� �
BCCWJ� �standard, though both

51



non-projective structure and right-to-left relation are permitted, we use the label ‘D’ to define a normal
dependency relation.

Third, we present the labels to resolve errors or discrepancies in the upper process. In the
� �
KC� �stan-

dard, all annotations are performed in the same research group. Hence, they do not define any special
labels for these errors or discrepancies. However, in the

� �
CSJ� �standard, the discrepancy of bunsetsu

boundaries is inherent to the original
� �
CSJ� �source, namely, speech. As such, the bunsetsu boundaries can

be inserted by a speech pause or an interval. In the syntactic layer, we sometimes need to concatenate
more than one item into one bunsetsu. In that case, the label ‘B+’ is introduced. In the

� �
BCCWJ� �stan-

dard, the bunsetsu and sentence boundaries are annotated by other research group based on morphology.
As a result of some discrepancies between the morphology and syntactic layer research group, we have
decided to introduce the labels ‘B’ for the bunsetsu and ‘Z’ for sentence boundaries. Note that, we permit
nested sentence in the

� �
BCCWJ� �standard.

Fourth, we present the labels to avoid annotating the dependency relation. In the
� �
KC� �standard, the

target data is from newspaper articles and tends to be normative. Therefore, no special label is assigned
to syntactic dependency relation. In contrast, the

� �
CSJ� �standard defines the label ‘D’ for disfluency, ‘F’

for filler, ‘C’ for conjunction, ‘E’ for interjection, ‘Y’ for call, ‘N’ for no dependency attachment, and
‘K’ for archaic words. In the

� �
BCCWJ� �standard, we define the label ‘F’ for filler or no dependency

attachment and ‘Z’ for sentence end or call. We also define the segments of ‘Foreign’ for the foreign
language region and ‘Disfluency’ for the disfluency region. In the segments, the dependency attachment
is to the neighbouring right bunsetsu.

3 Examples of Coordination and Apposition Structures

In this section, we exemplify the dependency annotation standards of coordination and apposition.

3.1 Coordination of nominal phrases

In the
� �
BCCWJ� �standard, coordinate structures of nominal phrases are represented by segments with the

label ‘Parallel’ with grouping. The dependency arc is labelled ‘D’. However, in the case of
� �
CSJ� �and� �

KC� �, the coordination of nominal phrases is expressed by the dependency arc labelled ‘P’.

3.2 Predicate coordination

Since the identification of a predicate coordination is difficult, the
� �
BCCWJ� �standard does not focus

on using labels or segments to define these structures. We regard a predicate coordination as a normal
dependency attachment (labelled ‘D’). As a comparison, the

� �
CSJ� �� �KC� �standards label ‘P’ for predicate

coordination.

P

3.3 Non-constituent coordination

The non-constituent coordinate structure may violate projective or double ‘を (wo: object marker)’ con-
straints. The

� �
CSJ� �� �KC� �standards define the label ‘I’ to show the scope of such coordination and to

maintain projective constraints. However, in the
� �
BCCWJ� �standard, we only define the segments on

non-constituent coordination and normal dependency attachment with the label ‘D’.� �

� �
3.4 Coordination with more than two constituents

In the
� �
BCCWJ� �standard, coordination with more than two constituents is expressed by segments which

are attached to the rightmost bunsetsu within the right adjacent coordinate constituent with the label ‘D’.
In the example, ‘風合い (texture)’, ‘風格 (dignity)’, and ‘高級感あふれる質感 (high-grade quality)’ are
expressed by grouping the segments. The conjunction ‘そして (and)’ (underlined in the below figure)
attaches the rightmost bunsetsu within the rightmost coordinate constituent with the label ‘D’.

In contrast, the

� �
CSJ� �standard labels ‘C’ for the conjunction. However, the illustration is omitted due

to space limitation.

3.5 Forward sharing

Forward sharing is a unique trait of a coordinate structure, in which one bunsetsu attaches all constituents
in the coordination.

In the example below, ‘オ（リックス）は (Orix TOP)’ attaches both ‘オーストリア (Austria)’ and
‘オーストラリア (Australia)’. Attaching the leftmost constituent of the coordination means forward
sharing. Note that since Japanese language is essentially a strictly final language, we are not concerned
about backward sharing.� �

3.6 Apposition in the narrow sense

In the
� �
BCCWJ� �standard, apposition structures are also expressed by segments and groups. The example

below illustrates that the appositive noun phrases, namely, ‘米国大統領 (US president)’ and ‘ジョン・F・
ケネディ(John F. Kennedy)’ are grouped and labelled ‘Apposition’. However, in the

� �
KC� �� �CSJ� �standards,

these appositive noun phrases are expressed by the dependency arc with the label ‘A’.

3.7 Generic – Apposition in a broad sense

In the
� �
KC� �standard, the apposition label ‘A’ is defined in the broad sense, which includes the apposition

between examples and generic expressions, and between examples and numeral expressions (attribute-
value relation). In comparison, the

� �
CSJ� �standard restricts the label ‘A’ to the narrow sense of apposition,

whereas the label ‘A2’ represents apposition in the broad sense.� �

4 Inter-clause attachment

Inter-clause attachment is one of issues of annotation consistency among the annotators. We use sub-
ordinate clause classes (Minami, 1974) to determine the inter clause attachments. Table 2 shows the
annotation schema. The subordinate clause is classified into three classes (i.e. A, B, C). The classes
define the scope of the constituents.

The most frequent inconsistency is the attachment of case markers. Whereas the subjective “-ga” can
attach to class B and C, the topicalization “-ha” can attach only to class C. Other case markers such as
the objectives “-wo” and “-ni” can attach to all classes.

In the definition, the annotators need to judge the usages of “-te” and the conjunctive form. However,
we did not record the judgment. In our future work, we will annotate the class of clauses.

5 Basic Statistics of the BCCWJ-DepPara

In this section, we present the basic statistics of the BCCWJ-DepPara data. Table 3 shows the number of
sample files, short unit words (SUW), long unit words (LUW), bunsetsus, the dependency arc labels of
‘D’, ‘B’, ‘F’, ‘Z’, and end of sentences (‘EOS’). The label ‘F’ in both OW and OY registers tends to be
larger than of those in the other registers. The OW register includes many item markers, whereas the OY
register includes many smiley strings, all labelled ‘F’. Since we permit nested sentences, the number of
the label ‘Z’ is more than the number of ‘EOS’1.

Table 4 shows the basic statistics of the coordination and apposition structures. The register ‘OW’
tends to include many ‘Parallel’ annotations. Because coordinate structures permit more than two con-
stituents, the average number of constituents (seg/grp) of coordinate structures ranges from 2.19-2.35.
However, since the ‘Apposition’ and ‘General’ labels are paired constituent structures, the average num-
ber of the constituents of these labels is nearly 2.00. Some exceptions of apposition expressions are
caused by paraphrasing more than one time in several forms.

6 Conclusion

This article presents the annotation standard of dependency and coordination structures in the BCCWJ-
DepPara. In the standard, the coordinate structure was taken out of the dependency structure, and it was,
then, expressed by segments and groups.

Due to space limitation, we have omitted the annotation standard related to the inter-clause attachment,
in which the scopes of phrases or clauses are defined by Minami’s clause classes(Minami, 1974). Though
the annotator used the clause classes for judgement, we did not annotate the clause classes on the corpus.
Our current work is to annotate the clause classes based on the standard of ‘Japanese Semantic Pattern
Dictionary – Compound and Complex Sentence Eds.’ (Ikehara, 2007).

The data of the BCCWJ-DepPara are accessible at http://bccwj-data.ninjal.ac.jp/
mdl/ for any purchaser of the BCCWJ DVD edition.

Parsing models should be adopted for the
� �
BCCWJ� �standard. (Iwatate, 2012) proposed a model that

involves the
� �
BCCWJ� �standard, in which the dependency attachments and coordinate structures are

estimated by a dual decomposition method.
