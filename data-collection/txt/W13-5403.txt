Abstract 

This study takes a corpus-based approach to 
examine twenty Chinese verbs that have been 
found to coerce their NP complements into an 
event type (cf. Lin et al. 2009), with an aim 
of creating a coercion profile for each verb. A 
cluster analysis is further conducted on the 
coercion profiles. The resulting clusters in 
our analysis show a bi-directional distribution: 
the verbs in Cluster 1 are found to coerce 
their complements more frequently, while the 
verbs in Cluster 2 are found to coerce more 
noun types. Moreover, many lexical pairs 
(e.g., antonyms and near-synonyms) are 
identified in the two clusters. Our quantitative 
analysis suggests that semantically related 
verbs can have similar coercion profiles. The 
empirical findings of the present study 
complement intuition-based studies on the 
complement coercion operation in Chinese 
(e.g., Lin and Liu 2004, Liu 2003) and shed 
new light on the theoretical framework of the 
Generative Lexicon. 

1 Introduction 

In our daily language, there are many 
mismatches in the surface form. A common 
example that is intriguing to semanticists is John 
began a book. Though the verb begin is supposed 
to take an event as its argument, the entity 
complement a book is also allowed for begin. 
The intended meaning can be that John began 
reading or writing a book. An enumerative 
approach may postulate another sense for begin. 
However, an economical proposal in the 
framework of the Generative Lexicon 
(Pustejovsky 1995) is the complement coercion 
operation, which leaves the meaning of the verb 

intact in different contexts by shifting the 
semantic type of its complement. In the above 
example, a book is shifted from an entity type to 
an event type. 

Such an operation also works in Chinese, as 
Lin et al. (2009) have demonstrated using the 
web as a corpus. Nevertheless, the complement 
coercion operation in Chinese is still 
under-researched through a corpus-based 
approach. The present study thus uses corpus 
data to explore twenty coercion verbs in Chinese, 
aiming to create a coercion profile for each verb. 
We believe that the empirical findings of the 
present study will greatly enrich the explanatory 
power of the Generative Lexicon. 

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
reviews the coercion operations proposed in the 
Generative Lexicon, and Section 3 reviews some 
previous studies on the complement coercion 
operation in Chinese. Section 4 introduces the 
methodology of the present study. Section 5 
presents the results. Section 6 discusses how the 
results can provide a revealing insight into 
lexical semantics. Section 7 provides a summary, 
highlights the contribution of the present study, 
and suggests potential directions for future 
studies.  

2 Coercion as a Generative Mechanism 
in the Generative Lexicon 

In the framework of the Generative Lexicon, a 
type coercion operation is defined as “a semantic 
operation that converts an argument to the type 
which is expected by a function, where it would 
otherwise result in a type error” (Pustejovsky 
1995:111), and two coercion mechanisms are 
proposed. 

First, consider the sentence in (1), which is 
perhaps the simplest case of coercion 
(Pustejovsky 1995:113):  



(1) Mary drives a Honda to work. 
This example is a case of subtype coercion: if an 
expression α of the type σ1 is a subtype of σ2, 
then between σ1 and σ2 is a possible coercion that 
allows the expression α to change its type from 
σ1 to σ2. In (1), a Honda is typed as a subtype of 
car. Further, car is a subtype of vehicle, 
which fulfills the selectional requirement of the 
governing verb drive.1 A coercion chain (i.e., 
Honda → car → vehicle) is formed, and it is 
the subtype coercion that makes a Honda a 
legitimate argument for the verb drive.  

Now, consider the following sentences 
(Pustejovsky 1995:115): 
(2) a. John began a book. 

b. John began reading a book. 
c. John began to read a book. 

In the above sentences, the complements of the 
verb began come in different forms. To capture 
their semantic relatedness and avoid treating 
begin in such a paradigm as a polysemous verb, 
Pustejovsky (1995) proposes a complement 
coercion operation. In the lexical representation 
of the verb begin (Pustejovsky 1995:116), the 
second argument of begin is explicitly typed as 
an event. Therefore, for the sentence (2a) to be 
semantically well-formed, the NP complement a 
book needs to be coerced into an event. This can 
be done by reconstructing an event reading from 
the qualia structure of book, where the values of 
the AGENTIVE role and the TELIC role are given 
as WRITE and READ, respectively. That is, a book 
in (2a) can be interpreted as an event of writing a 
book or an event of reading a book. Such a 
complement coercion is triggered by the 
governing verb. Moreover, without a qualia value 
appropriate in the context, such a complement 
coercion would be impossible. This proposal has 
two major consequences. First, an enumerative 
approach to the semantics of a verb can be 
avoided－that is, the meaning of begin in begin a 
book, begin a movie, etc. remains identical. 
Second, the semantic load is spread more evenly 
between a verb and its complement.  

The complement coercion operation in the 
Generative Lexicon is not just a theoretical 
construct, but has also been empirically 
supported (e.g., Baggio et al. 2009, Delogu et al. 

                                                 
1 For the lexical representation of the verb drive, refer to 
Pustejovsky (1995:114).  

2010, Traxler et al. 2002, and Traxler et al. 2005). 
The hypothesis is that in processing an 
expression such as began the book, we adopt the 
following strategies (Traxler et al. 2005:4): 

“When encountering the noun book, 
comprehenders access the word’s lexical 
entry and attempt to integrate various stored 
senses of this word into the evolving 
semantic representation of the sentence. The 
mismatch between the verb’s selectional 
restrictions and the stored senses of the 
noun triggers a coercion process. 
Comprehenders use salient properties 
associated with the complement noun and 
other relevant discourse elements (including 
but not necessarily limited to the agent 
phrase) to infer a plausible action that could 
be performed on the noun. Comprehenders 
incorporate the event sense into their 
semantic interpretation of the VP by 
reconfiguring the semantic representation of 
the complement, converting [βbegan[αThe 
book]] into [βbegan[αreading the book]]. 
(Conceivably, this could also require 
reconfiguration of an associated syntactic 
representation.)” 

The results of various experiments (e.g., 
eye-tracking experiments, ERPs) have shown 
that the processing cost is associated with the last 
stage, i.e., reconstructing an event reading for the 
NP complement. 

3 Studies on the Complement Coercion 
Operation in Chinese 

There has been a lack of empirical studies 
exploring the coercion operations in Chinese. To 
our knowledge, the only study from the 
psycholinguistic perspective is Wang (2008), 
where the aspectual coercion operation in 
Chinese was investigated. Additionally, 
corpus-based studies are also rare. One of them 
is Huang and Ahrens (2003). It is suggested that 
some classifiers in Chinese (e.g., tang ‘a journey’ 
and hui ‘a round’) can coerce an 
individual-denoting noun to represent an event 
(Huang and Ahrens 2003:368). Specifically, 
regarding the complement coercion operation in 
Chinese, no psycholinguistic/neurolinguistic 
study has been conducted, and a corpus-based 
study waits until Lin et al. (2009). 



The reason why the complement coercion 
operation in Chinese has not received adequate 
attention is that it is generally held that there is 
no true complement coercion in Chinese. This 
claim is based on the observation that while John 
began a book is grammatical, its literal 
translation into Chinese Yuehan kaishi yi-ben shu 
is unacceptable (Lin and Liu 2004, Liu 2003)－a 
Chinese speaker must say Yuehan kaishi du 
yi-ben shu ‘John began to read a book’. Such an 
argument appears to be shaky (Lin et al. 2009): 
there are many English sentences in the literature 
of the complement coercion operation, but only 
began a book is translated into Chinese in Lin 
and Liu (2004).  

To answer whether the complement coercion 
operation works in Chinese, Lin et al. (2009) 
used the web as a corpus. After collecting a set of 
control verbs in Chinese, they googled these 
verbs and randomly examined their objects. For 
example, one of the verb-object pairs from 
Google was zhizai daxue ‘aim (at) college’. Next, 
the pairs were put in the template “V * O”, where 
the asterisk enabled the search engine to get 
anything between the verb and its object. With 
the template zhizai * daxue, the following is one 
of the sentences retrieved from the web: 
(3) ta zhizai  shang  daxue 

he  aim to attend college 
‘He aimed to attend college.’ 

In (3), the complement daxue is coerced with an 
event reading (i.e., attending college) for the 
phrase zhizai daxue to be semantically 
well-formed. Cross-linguistically, such an 
example shows that the complement coercion 
operation does work not only in English but also 
in Chinese. The phrase zhizai daxue is acceptable, 
and its non-coercive counterpart is also attested. 
Methodologically, the asterisk in the template 
can help to automatically identify the agentive 
role or the telic role of an NP complement (e.g., 
shang ‘attend’ for daxue ‘college’). The method 
proposed in Lin et al. (2009) can be applied to 
further studies on the complement coercion 
operation in Chinese. 

In summary, the study on the complement 
coercion operation in Chinese is still in its 
infancy, and corpus-based methods is worth 
pursuing because it can provide a 
language-specific insight into the complement 
coercion operation as a generative mechanism. 

4 Method 

The database for the present study was the 
Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern 
Chinese (i.e., the Sinica Corpus, for short), which 
can be accessed through the Chinese Word 
Sketch Engine.2  

Generally, the selection of the verbs for our 
analysis was based on the appendix in Lin et al. 
(2009), where 36 complement coercion verbs in 
Chinese are listed.3 First, disyllabic verbs were 
selected. Second, verbs with a low frequency 
(i.e., no more than 100 tokens in the Sinica 
Corpus) were not considered. Third, the present 
study focused on the prototypical case of the 
complement coercion operation in the literature, 
i.e., coercing an NP complement into an event 
type. Thus, verbs that seemingly take a 
proposition (i.e., zancheng ‘approve’ and tongyi 
‘agree’) were not examined in the present study. 
Finally, 20 verbs in the appendix of Lin et al. 
(2009) were selected for further analysis. They 
are presented in the appendix of this paper. 

For each of the 20 verbs, 120 sentences were 
randomly sampled from the Sinica Corpus. Of all 
the 2,400 sentences, those in which the verb was 
nominalized or did not take a complement were 
not analyzed. Here is an example: 
(4) rang haizi jinliang de qu duofang tansuo  
 yu changshi 

let child as.much.as.possible DE go 
in.many.ways explore and try 
‘let children explore and try as much as 
possible’ 

In (4), the complement of the verb changshi is 
missing and hard to recover from the context. 
Therefore, such sentences were not analyzed in 
the present study. In total, 1,586 sentences were 
analyzed.  

For each sentence analyzed in the present 
study, whether there was a complement coercion 
operation was manually checked. Consider the 
following example:  
(5) wei jiankang er pao, zai zuotian shunli  
 wancheng disan zhan  

                                                 
2 The Chinese Word Sketch Engine is available at 
http://wordsketch.ling.sinica.edu.tw/. For more details about 
the Sinica Corpus, refer to 
http://db1x.sinica.edu.tw/cgi-bin/kiwi/mkiwi/mkiwi.sh. 
3 Note that the complement coercion verbs listed in the 
appendix of Lin et al. (2007) are not exhaustive. 



for health ER run, on yesterday smoothly 
finish third stop 
‘(someone) ran for the sake of health and 
successfully finished the third stop 
yesterday’ 

In (5), it is the task of arriving at the third stop 
that is completed. This sentence was coded as 
showing a complement coercion operation in 
Chinese. The complement disan zhan ‘the third 
stop’ was recorded as a noun type that could be 
coerced. 4  The distance between the coercing 
verb and the coerced complement was coded as 1 
because the complement occurs in the first word 
right to wancheng.  

5 Results 

Overall, of the 1,586 sentences analyzed in the 
present study, 264 sentences (16.64%) show a 
complement coercion operation. The results are 
presented in the appendix. The columns (D), (E), 
(F), and (G) are used to represent the 
complement coercion profiles of the verbs 
examined in the present study. First, the higher 
the value in (D) is, the more frequently the verb 
coerces its complement. Second, the higher the 
value in (E) is, the more the verb is preferred in a 
complement coercion operation. Generally, there 
is a linear relationship between the values in (D) 
and (E), as illustrated in Figure 1. However, it is 
noted that though some verbs coerce their 
complement often, the degree to which they are 
preferred in a complement coercion operation 
can be relatively lower. For instance, as shown in 
the appendix, kangju ‘resist’ (29.2%, i.e., 12 out 
of 41 sentences featuring kangju) coerces a 
complement marginally more often than xuyao 
‘need’ (28.5%, i.e., 24 out of 84 sentences 
featuring xuyao), but the former (4.5%, i.e., 12 
out of 264 sentences featuring a complement 
coercion operation) is slightly less preferred in a 
complement coercion operation than the latter 
(9.0%, i.e., 24 out of 264 sentences featuring a 
complement coercion operation). In the 
representation of the coercion profile of a verb, 
such a difference should be taken into account. 
 

 

                                                 
4 The term type is used here as in type frequency (i.e., 
opposed to token frequency), not used to refer to a semantic 
type (e.g., an individual, an event, etc.).

across the verbs 
 
Third, the higher the value in (F) is, the more 
noun types the verb coerces. Fourth, the higher 
the value in (G) is, the stronger the coercion 
power of the verb is－in the sense that the verb 
can coerce a noun that does not syntagmatically 
adjoin. In brief, the four columns (D), (E), (F), 
and (G) in the appendix are regarded as 
reflecting the complement coercion profile of a 
verb in Chinese. 

The four columns (D), (E), (F), and (G) in the 
appendix were scaled and then used to perform a 
partitioning around medoids (Kaufman and 
Rousseeuw 1990).5 Such a multivariate analysis 
is exploratory. Many variables are taken into 
account, and we are allowed to get a panorama of 
how the twenty verbs in Chinese are organized in 
terms of the complement coercion operation. No 
specific pattern is expected, but the one actually 
obtained with our data can be interesting and 
revealing to a certain degree. 

In our multivariate analysis, the optimal 
clusters for the twenty verbs examined in the 
present study were estimated to be three. The 
results are presented in (6):  
(6) Cluster 1 (8 in total): changshi ‘try’,  

cuoguo ‘miss (fail to do something)’, jujue 
‘refuse’, kangju ‘resist’, taoyan ‘dislike’, 
tuijian ‘recommend’, xihuan ‘like’, xuyao 
‘need’ 
Cluster 2 (11 in total): bimian ‘avoid’, fuze 
‘be responsible for’, jixu ‘continue’, 
jueding ‘decide’, kaishi ‘begin’, kewang 
‘long for’, mianqiang ‘force’, tingzhi ‘stop’, 
wancheng ‘finish’, yaoqiu ‘require’, yunxu 
‘allow’ 

                                                 
5 The analysis was conducted in R. The pamk function in 
the package fpc was used. 



Cluster 3 (only 1): jinzhi ‘forbid’ 
To reveal the differences between Cluster 1 

and Cluster 2, the Mann-Whitney test was 
performed on the means of the four columns (D), 
(E), (F), and (G) in the appendix. Table 1 
summarizes the results. 

 
 Cluster 1 Cluster 2 p-value  
Column (D) 0.365 0.082 0.000053 *
Column (E) 0.090 0.025 0.000106 *
Column (F) 0.799 0.992 0.000026 *
Column (G) 2.620 3.076 0.177400 

Table 1. Differences between Cluster 1 and 
Cluster 2 

 
The verbs in Cluster 1 coerce their complements 
more frequently. Moreover, they are also 
characterized by their greater extent to which 
they are preferred in a complement coercion 
operation. On the other hand, the verbs in Cluster 
2 coerce more noun types than those in Cluster 1. 
Finally, the distance between a verb and its 
coerced complement is not found to be a 
statistically significant variable that distinguishes 
the two clusters.  

Though Lin et al. (2009) found that jinzhi 
‘forbid’ could coerce its complement, such a use 
was not attested in the Sinica Corpus. Therefore, 
the verb jinzhi itself forms a cluster. 

6 Discussion 

Generally, on the basis of their coercion 
profiles, the verbs examined in the present study 
can be grouped into two major clusters. In the 
following discussion, we will further zoom in to 
see how the verbs in each cluster are 
semantically related. Moreover, we will show 
that the empirical findings of the present study 
can shed new light on the framework of the 
Generative Lexicon. 

Of the eight verbs in the first cluster, five 
denote enjoyment and volition: xihuan ‘like’, 
taoyan ‘dislike’, tuijian ‘recommend’, jujue 
‘refuse’, and kangju ‘resist’. They are compatible 
with referentially opaque nouns (cf. Pustejovsky 
1995:181), i.e., nouns that are weakly 
constrained by their qualia roles (the AGENTIVE 
role and the TELIC role, in particular). For such a 
noun, an event reading can be reconstructed from 
the context. Here is an example:  

(7) wo dangran xiwang guanzhong xihuan wo  
 I definitely hope audience like I 

‘I definitely hope that the audience like (to 
watch) me’ 

In (7), though wo ‘I; me’ is referentially opaque, 
an event reading (i.e., watching me) can be 
reconstructed from guanzhong ‘audience’. A 
referentially opaque noun such as wo ‘I; me’ can 
have a relatively higher frequency. The semantic 
compatibility between a 
enjoyment/volition-denoting verb and a 
referentially opaque noun may explain why the 
verbs in Cluster 1 coerce a complement more 
frequently but coerce fewer noun types.  

The verbs in the second cluster are also 
semantically related to some extent: four verbs 
denote the beginning or the ending of an event, 
i.e., kaishi ‘begin’, wancheng ‘finish’, tingzhi 
‘stop’, and jixu ‘continue’. Thus, they prefer 
referentially transparent nouns (cf. Pustejovsky 
1995:181) that are given a process in the 
AGENTIVE role or the TELIC role, and an event 
reading is reconstructed from the qualia structure 
of a complement. Here is an example:  
(8) wancheng le geng duo xin dianying  
 finish LE more many new movie 

‘(someone) has finished (shooting) more 
new movies’ 

The AGENTIVE role of dianying ‘movie’ can be 
SHOOT, which is a process that someone can start, 
finish, stop, or continue. 

Furthermore, as can be observed in our 
quantitative data presented in the appendix, 
antonyms and near-synonyms may have similar 
profiles in terms of the complement coercion 
operation, and they can be clustered together 
accordingly － e.g., the antonym pair xihuan 
‘like’/taoyan ‘dislike’ and the near-synonym pair 
jujue ‘refuse’/kangju ‘resist’ in Cluster 1; the 
anontym pairs kaishi ‘begin’/wancheng ‘finish’ 
and jixu ‘continue’/tingzhi ‘stop’ in Cluster 2. 
Note that though the antonyms yunxu ‘allow’ and 
jinzhi ‘forbid’ are in different clusters (i.e., 
Cluster 2 and Cluster 3, respectively), they are 
similar in that neither coerces a complement 
frequently. There are some intriguing cases, 
though. For example, xuyao ‘need’ and yaoqiu 
‘require’ can be seen as near-synonyms in 
Chinese, but they are not clustered together. 

In Chinese, the verb jinzhi ‘forbid’ is often 
used in a fairly formal style, and its context 



usually leaves little room for a misinterpretation. 
A misinterpretation can arise from the process of 
reconstructing an event reading, for the process 
is inferential. This may explain why the verb 
jinzhi is not found in our data to occur in a 
complement coercion operation. However, note 
that the semantics of jinzhi does not inherently 
keep the verb from coercing its complement. Lin 
et al. (2009), using the web as a corpus, have 
attested jinzhi in a complement coercion 
operation. 

In the exploration of the complement coercion 
operation in Chinese, the present study makes 
one step more abstract in co-selectional terms. 
When checking whether a context features a 
complement coercion operation, we did not 
simply sort out the frequent collocations of a 
verb as we usually do to identify the 
collocational patterns of a lexical item. Rather, 
we needed to manually assign a semantic type 
(i.e., entity, event, etc.) to each complement to 
construct the complement coercion profile of a 
verb. Though many attempts have been made to 
investigate the abstract dimensions of a lexical 
profile (e.g., the semantic preference of a lexical 
item), few have incorporated the coercion profile 
of a verb into a verbal profile. The present study 
shows that the behavioral profile of a verb can 
include a more abstract dimension, i.e., how the 
verb interacts with the complement coercion 
operation. This suggests that the Generative 
Lexicon can provide a fresh insight into 
co-selectional/collocational studies. 

On the other hand, the findings of the present 
study have shed new light on the Generative 
Lexicon. First, the present study is corpus-based, 
thus offering empirical support for theoretical 
operations in the Generative Lexicon. Second, 
the present study examines Chinese data, thus 
providing cross-linguistic support for the 
Generative Lexicon. The findings here echo Lin 
et al. (2009), demonstrating that the complement 
coercion operation is truly a useful mechanism in 
Chinese. Third, the present study shows that 
lexical relations (e.g., antonymy and 
near-synonymy) can be revealed through the 
interaction between the qualia structure and the 
complement coercion operation, and this 
suggests that the Generative Lexicon achieves its 
goal to capture the global organization of a 
lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995:61). 

Finally, the theory of norms and exploitations 
(Hanks 2009, 2013) can be related to the 
Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995), though 
the two theories take different approaches to our 
language use. They are similar in two ways. First, 
in the two theories, semantics is given 
precedence over syntax. Second, the two theories 
attempt to account for novel usages which may 
seem unusual or abnormal at first sight. The type 
mismatch examined in the present study is an 
example. As have been discussed, the Generative 
Lexicon deals with type mismatches through the 
qualia structure and the complement coercion 
operation. In Hank’s theory, two systems 
collaborate: the primary one governs 
conventional usages (i.e., norms), and the 
secondary one governs the exploitation of 
conventional usages (i.e., exploitations). The two 
systems cannot be sharply distinguished because 
a repeated exploitation may finally become a 
norm. Hanks suggests that the normality of an 
utterance depends on statistical analyses. In 
Chinese, the type mismatch between a verb and 
its complement can be seen as an exploitation: 
the surface form is a conventional usage in 
Chinese (i.e., a verb followed by a nominal 
complement), and it is exploited for economical 
reasons (i.e., the speaker does not need to 
explicitly specify the event). However, with the 
quantitative data from the Sinica Corpus, we 
have found that the complement coercion 
operation in Chinese is more dominant for some 
verbs (e.g., cuoguo ‘fail to do something’) than 
for others (e.g., jixu ‘continue’). In other words, 
the complement coercion operation in Chinese 
can be seen as a norm for some verbs yet as an 
exploitation for others. This is exactly the insight 
that such a data-based model as the theory of 
norms and exploitations can provide for a 
generative model. While the Generative Lexicon 
can provide mechanisms to account for how a 
complement can be coerced, the theory of norms 
and exploitations can focus on how compatible 
an individual word is with the complement 
coercion operation. In short, the former is a 
model of rules and restrictions, while the latter is 
a model of preferences and probabilities. The 
two models can thus complement each other. 

 
 



7 Concluding Remarks 

Our corpus-based study explores the complement 
coercion operation in Chinese. The present study 
examined twenty verbs, creating a coercion 
profile for each verb. A multivariate analysis was 
conducted on the coercion profiles to cluster the 
twenty verbs. There are two major clusters: the 
verbs in Cluster 1 coerce a complement more 
frequently, while the verbs in Cluster 2 coerce 
more noun types. The differences can be 
attributed to the semantics of the verbs. 
Moreover, many lexical pairs (e.g., antonyms and 
near-synonyms) are identified in the two clusters. 
Our quantitative analysis suggests that 
semantically related verbs can have similar 
coercion profiles.  

As suggested in our review, empirical studies 
on the complement coercion operation in 
Chinese are still rare. Our study is corpus-based, 
complementing intuition-based studies in 
Chinese (e.g., Lin and Liu 2004, Liu 2003). 
Additionally, the distributional patterns identified 
in the present study show that a data-based 
approach can complement a generative model 
that places more emphasis on rules and 
restrictions. The present study can be extended 
with more verbs analyzed and perhaps more 
variables taken into account. 

Further studies can adopt other empirical 
approaches to explore the complement coercion 
operation in Chinese. For example, 
psycholinguistic/neurolinguistic studies can be 
conducted to see how Chinese speakers process 
the complement coercion operation, and 
acquisition studies are also needed. The 
framework of the Generative Lexicon can thus 
benefit from the integration of various empirical 
approaches.
