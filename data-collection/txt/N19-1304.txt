Abstract

We provide an NLP framework to uncover
four linguistic dimensions of political polar-
ization in social media: topic choice, framing,
affect and illocutionary force. We quantify
these aspects with existing lexical methods,
and propose clustering of tweet embeddings
as a means to identify salient topics for analy-
sis across events; human evaluations show that
our approach generates more cohesive topics
than traditional LDA-based models. We ap-
ply our methods to study 4.4M tweets on 21
mass shootings. We provide evidence that the
discussion of these events is highly polarized
politically and that this polarization is primar-
ily driven by partisan differences in framing
rather than topic choice. We identify framing
devices, such as grounding and the contrasting
use of the terms “terrorist” and “crazy”, that
contribute to polarization. Results pertaining
to topic choice, affect and illocutionary force
suggest that Republicans focus more on the
shooter and event-specific facts (news) while
Democrats focus more on the victims and call
for policy changes. Our work contributes to
a deeper understanding of the way group di-
visions manifest in language and to computa-
tional methods for studying them.1

1 Introduction

Elites, political parties, and the media in the US
are increasingly polarized (Layman et al., 2010;
Prior, 2013; Gentzkow et al., forthcoming), and
the propagation of partisan frames can influence
public opinion (Chong and Druckman, 2007) and
party identification (Fiorina and Abrams, 2008).

Americans increasingly get their news from
internet-based sources (Mitchell et al., 2016),
and political information-sharing is highly ide-
ologically segregated on platforms like Twitter
(Conover et al., 2011; Halberstam and Knight,

1All data and code is available at: https://github.
com/ddemszky/framing-twitter

2016) and Facebook (Bakshy et al., 2015). Prior
NLP work has shown, e.g., that polarized mes-
sages are more likely to be shared (Zafar et al.,
2016) and that certain topics are more polarizing
(Balasubramanyan et al., 2012); however, we lack
a more broad understanding of the many ways that
polarization can be instantiated linguistically.

This work builds a more comprehensive frame-
work for studying linguistic aspects of polariza-
tion in social media, by looking at topic choice,
framing, affect, and illocutionary force.

1.1 Mass Shootings
We explore these aspects of polarization by study-
ing a sample of more than 4.4M tweets about
21 mass shooting events, analyzing polarization
within and across events.

Framing and polarization in the context of mass
shootings is well-studied, though much of the lit-
erature studies the role of media (Chyi and Mc-
Combs, 2004; Schildkraut and Elsass, 2016) and
politicians (Johnson et al., 2017). Several works
find that frames have changed over time and be-
tween such events (Muschert and Carr, 2006;
Schildkraut and Muschert, 2014), and that frames
influence opinions on gun policies (HaiderMarkel
and Joslyn, 2001). Prior NLP work in this area
has considered how to extract factual informa-
tion on gun violence from news (Pavlick et al.,
2016) as well as quantify stance and public opin-
ion on Twitter (Benton et al., 2016) and across the
web (Ayers et al., 2016); here we advance NLP ap-
proaches to the public discourse surrounding gun
violence by introducing methods to analyze other
linguistic manifestations of polarization.

1.2 The Role of the Shooter’s Race
We are particularly interested in the role of the
shooter’s race in shaping polarized responses to
these events. Implicit or explicit racial biases
can be central in people’s understanding of social



2971

problems (Drakulich, 2015); in the mass shoot-
ing context, race is a factor in an event’s news-
worthiness (Schildkraut et al., 2018) and is often
mentioned prominently in media coverage, partic-
ularly when the shooter is non-white (Mingus and
Zopf, 2010; Park et al., 2012). Duxbury et al.
(2018) find that media representations of white
shooters disproportionately divert blame by fram-
ing them as mentally ill while representations of
non-white shooters are more frequently criminal-
ized, highlighting histories of violent behavior.

The important question remains as to how polar-
ized ideologies surrounding race take shape on fo-
rums such as Twitter. Therefore, in all of the anal-
yses throughout this paper we consider the race of
the shooter as a potential factor. We note that in the
21 shooting events we study, shootings in schools
and places of worship are overwhelmingly carried
out by white perpetrators, so we cannot fully dis-
entangle the effect of race from other factors.

2 Data: Tweets on Mass Shootings

Data collection. We compiled a list of mass
shootings between 2015 and 2018 from the Gun
Violence Archive.2 For each, we identified a list of
keywords representative of their location (see Ap-
pendix A). Given Twitter search API’s limitations
on past tweets, we retrieved data from a Stanford
lab’s archived intake of the Twitter firehose.3

For each event, we built a list of relevant
tweets for the two weeks following the event.
A tweet is relevant if it contained at least one
of the event’s location-based representative key-
words and at least one lemma from the following
list: “shoot”, “gun”, “kill”, “attack”, “massacre”,
“victim”. We filtered out retweets and tweets from
users who have since been deactivated. We kept
those 21 events with more than 10,000 tweets re-
maining. For more details see Appendix A.

Partisan assignment. We estimate the party af-
filiation of users in the dataset from the political
accounts they follow using a method similar to that
of Volkova et al. (2014), which takes advantage
of homophily in the following behavior of users
on twitter (Halberstam and Knight, 2016). We
compile a list of Twitter handles of US Congress
members in 2017, the 2016 presidential and vice

Pittsburgh and Thousand Oaks, for which we collected tweets

presidential candidates, and other party-affiliated
pages.4 We label a user as a Democrat if they
followed more Democratic than Republican politi-
cians in November 2017, and as a Republican if
the reverse is true. For each event, 51–72% of
users can be assigned partisanship in this way; to
validate our method we compare state averages
of these inferred partisan labels to state two-party
vote shares, finding a high correlation (Figure 1).5

3 Quantifying Overall Polarization

We begin by quantifying polarization (equiva-
lently, partisanship) between the language of users
labeled Democrats and Republicans after mass
shooting events. We establish that there is sub-
stantial polarization, and that the polarization in-
creases over time within most events.

3.1 Methods

Pre-processing. We first build a vocabulary for
each event as follows. Each vocabulary contains
unigrams and bigrams that occur in a given event’s
tweets at least 50 times, counted after stemming
via NLTK’s SnowballStemmer and stopword re-
moval.6 We refer to these unigrams and bigrams
collectively as tokens.

4See Appendix B.1 for the complete list.
5We performed the sanity check for all partisan users with

a valid US state as part of their geo-location (⇠350k users).
6Stopword list is provided in Appendix A.1

Measure of partisanship. We apply the
leave-out estimator of phrase partisanship from
Gentzkow et al. (forthcoming). Partisanship is
defined as the expected posterior probability that
an observer with a neutral prior would assign to a
tweeter’s true party after observing a single token
drawn at random from the tweets produced by the
tweeter. If there is no difference in token usage
between the two parties, then this probability is
.5, i.e. we cannot guess the user’s party any better
after observing a token.

The leave-out estimator consistently estimates
partisanship under the assumption that a user’s to-
kens are drawn from a multinomial logit model.
The estimator is robust to corpus size. The
leave-out estimate of partisanship ⇡LO between
Democrats i 2 D and Republicans i 2 R is

estimator thus captures two intuitive components
of partisanship: between-group difference (poste-
rior probability for each feature), and within-group
similarity (dot-product between the feature vector
of each speaker and that of their group).

User-level measures. As the above leave-out es-
timator represents the average of user-level polar-
ization values, we take the user-level dot product
(q̂i · ⇢̂�i) as an estimate of the polarization of user
i’s language. We consider the correlation of this
value and the number of politicians a user follows
in total and from their preferred party.

3.2 Results and Discussion

discussion of each event7 is highly polarized: val-
ues range from .517 to .547. For comparison, this

exclude Fort Lauderdale for which we only have tweets for
the first day after the event; polarization is most dominant
a few days after each event, making it incomparable. For
reference, the leave-out estimate for Fort Lauderdale is .51.

actual value value resulting from random party assignment

Figure 2: Tweets on mass shootings are highly polar-
ized, as measured by the leave-out estimate of phrase
partisanship (Gentzkow et al., forthcoming). The
shaded region represents the 95% confidence interval
of the linear regression fit to the actual values. To quan-
tify noise, we also calculate the leave-out estimate after
randomly assigning users to parties, matching the ratio
of parties in the true data. The “values resulting from
random assignment” are all close to .5, suggesting that
the actual values are not a result of noise.

measure, for most events, is similar to or higher
than the polarization in the US congress (⇠ .53
in recent years) (Gentzkow et al., forthcoming).
While we observe a slight increase in polarization
over the past three years, this increase is not statis-
tically significant (p ⇡ .26).

Post-event polarization. To see how polariza-
tion changes at the event level, we computed the
leave-out estimate for each of the first 10 days fol-
lowing the events (see Figure 3). An event-day
level regression of partisanship on days since the
event suggests a slight increase in post-event po-
larization across events (slope = .002, p < 0.05).
Fitting separate regressions, we find that the five
events with the steepest increase in polarization
are Burlington (slope = .03, p < 0.05), Orlando
(slope = .006, p < 0.001), Las Vegas (slope =
.003, p < 0.001), Chattanooga (slope = .003,
p < 0.05) and Roseburg (slope = .003, p < 0.05)
— note that except for Las Vegas, these shootings
are all committed by a person of color.

Are the changes in the leave-out score due to
different users tweeting at different times or due
to the same users becoming more or less politi-
cal? We found that while on average only ⇠ 10%
of users tweeted on multiple days (SD = 5%)
across the events, these users contribute ⇠ 28%
of the tweets (SD = 15%). After removing these
users from the leave-out estimation, we found that
the temporal patterns remain with the same statis-
tical significance, providing one piece of evidence

within users who tweet on multiple days.

User-level polarization. We estimated a linear
regression of the leave-out score on the total num-
ber of followed politicians and the number from
the user’s preferred party, with controls for event
indicators. The estimates imply that, fixing the to-
tal number of followed politicians, one more fol-
lowed politician from one’s preferred party is as-
sociated with an increase of .009 SD in the leave-
out. Fixing the number of followed politicians
from the user’s preferred party, one more followed
politician is associated with a decrease of .02 SD
in the leave-out.

4 Topics and Framing

Topic choice can be a tool for agenda-setting
by establishing what an author or institution
deems worthy of discussion (McCombs, 2002),
and works in NLP have used topic modeling as
an approach to measure this effect (Tsur et al.,
2015; Field et al., 2018). The strategy of highlight-
ing particular aspects within topics as a means of
framing (Entman, 2007) has also been quantified
in the NLP literature (Boydstun et al., 2013; Card
et al., 2015; Naderi and Hirst, 2017).

Previous work largely focuses on the relation
between topic and framing in the news media; we
study social media, proposing methods to identify
general, non-event-specific topics and to quantify
between- and within-topic polarization.

4.1 Methods
Topic assignment. Our goal is to induce topics
that are salient in our narrow domain and compara-
ble across events. This presents a challenge for tra-
ditional topic modeling approaches, since the dis-
course surrounding these events is inherently tied
to concrete aspects of the events that tend to co-
vary with topic usage, like location, setting, and

demographics of the shooter and victims.
We build on the ability of vector space mod-

els to represent higher-level semantics to develop
our own embedding-based topic assignment ap-
proach, comparing it with two traditional LDA-
based methods: MALLET8 and the Biterm Topic
Model (BTM) (Yan et al., 2013); BTM was devel-
oped specifically for tweets. For all of these meth-
ods, we first randomly sample 10k tweets from
each event forming our subset S of all tweets T ;
then, we create a vocabulary V of word stems that
occur at least ten times in at least three events
within S (⇠2000 word stems) and remove all
stems from T are not part of V . Sampling is
crucial for encouraging event-independent topics
given the large disparity among event-level tweet
counts (the largest event, Orlando, has 225⇥ more
tweets than the smallest event, Burlington).

For the embedding-based approach, we:
1. Train GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al.,
2014) on V based on 11-50k random samples of
tweets from each event.9

2. Create sentence embeddings et, 8t 2 T using
Arora et al. (2017)’s method, by computing the
weighted average vt of the embeddings of stems
within t and removing vt’s projection onto the
first principal component of the matrix the rows
of which are vt, 8t 2 S. Stem weights are set to
be inversely proportional to their frequencies in S.
3. Jointly cluster the embeddings et, 8t 2 S via
k-means using cosine distance and assign all tweet
embeddings et, 8t 2 T to the centroids to which
they are closest.

We also trained MALLET and BTM on S and
used the resulting models to infer topics for all
tweets in T , assigning each tweet to its highest
probability topic. Henceforth, we use d to mean
cosine distance for k-means and probabilities for
MALLET and BTM.

A manual inspection found that about 25% of
the tweets are either difficult to assign to any topic
or they represent multiple topics equally. To filter
out such tweets, for each tweet we looked at the ra-
tio of d to its closest and second closest topic and
removed tweets that have ratios higher than the
75th percentile (calculated at the model-level).10

8http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php
9This sample is different from S as it includes more

tweets to increase data size, which is important for training
the embeddings, where the slightly disproportional represen-
tation of events is less problematic.

10This procedure filters out 11-26% tweets (M=22%,

Table 1: Our eight topics (with their average propor-
tions across events) and nearest-neighbor stem embed-
dings to the cluster centroids. Topic names were man-
ually assigned based on inspecting the tweets.

To compare the models, we ran two MTurk ex-
periments: a word intrusion task (Chang et al.,
2009) and our own, analogically defined tweet in-
trusion task, with the number of topics k ranging
between 6-10. Turkers were presented with either
a set of 6 words (for word intrusion) or a set of
4 tweets (for tweet intrusion), all except one of
which was close (in terms of d) to a randomly cho-
sen topic and one that was far from that topic but
close to another topic. Then, Turkers were asked
to pick the odd one out among the set of words /
tweets. More details in Appendix D.

We find that our model outperforms the LDA-
based methods with respect to both tasks, particu-
larly tweet intrusion — see Figure 4. This suggests
that our model both provides more cohesive topics
at the word level and more cohesive groupings by
topic assignment. The choice of k does not yield
a significant difference among model-level accu-
racies. However, since k = 8 slightly outperforms
other k-s in tweet intrusion, we use it for further
analysis. See Table 1 for nearest neighbor stems to
each topic and Appendix C.2 for example tweets.

tisanship. Recall that the leave-out estimator

topic polarization of the 21 events in our dataset show
that within-topic polarization is increasing over time
while between-topic polarization remains stable.

from Section 3.1 provides a measure of partisan-
ship. The information in a tweet, and thus par-
tisanship, can be decomposed into which topic is
discussed, and how it’s discussed.

To measure within-topic partisanship for a par-
ticular event, i.e. how a user discusses a given
topic, we re-apply the leave-out estimator. For
each topic, we calculate the partisanship using
only tweets categorized to that topic. Then, over-
all within-topic partisanship for the event is the
weighted mean of these values, with weights given
by the proportion of tweets categorized to each
topic within each event.

Between-topic partisanship is defined as the ex-
pected posterior that an observer with a neutral
prior would assign to a user’s true party after learn-
ing only the topic — but not the words — of a
user’s tweet. We estimate this value by replacing
each tweet with its assigned topic and applying the
leave-out estimator to this data.

4.2 Results

Figure 5 shows that for most events within-topic is
higher than between-topic partisanship, suggest-
ing that while topic choice does play a role in
phrase partisanship (its values are meaningfully
higher than .5), within-topic phrase usage is sig-
nificantly more polarized. Linear estimates of
the relationship between within and between topic
partisanship and time show that while within-topic
polarization has increased over time, between-
topic polarization has remained stable. This find-
ing supports the idea that topic choice and topic-
level framing are distinct phenomena.

Partisanship also differs by topic, and within
days after a given event. Figure 6 shows po-
larization within topics for 9 days after Las Ve-

tion of each topic in the data at a given time.

gas. We find that solidarity has the lowest and
shooter’s identity & ideology the highest polar-
ization throughout; polarization in most topics in-
creases over time and news has the steepest in-
crease. Similar patterns are present after Orlando
(Figure 17 in Appendix I). Measuring polarization
of topics for other events over time is noisy, given
the sparsity of the data, but overall within-topic
polarization is consistent: the most polarized top-
ics on average across events are shooter’s identity
& ideology (.55) and laws & policy (.54), where
people are apparently polarized about both why
an event happened and what to do about it. Fact-
and sympathy-based topics display less polariza-
tion: news (.51), victims & location (.52), solidar-
ity (.52) and remembrance (.52).

As shown in Figure 7, investigation, news, and
shooter’s identity & ideology are more likely to
be discussed by Republicans and laws & pol-
icy and solidarity more likely to be discussed by
Democrats across events.11 Topics preferred by
Republicans seem to relate more to the shooter
than to the victims, while topics preferred by
Democrats seem to relate more closely to the
victims. The shooter’s race appears to play
a role in topic preference: if the shooter is
white, Democrats become more likely to focus on
shooter’s identity & ideology and laws & policy
and Republicans on news and investigation than if
the shooter is a person of color.

5 Specific Framing Devices
In the previous section, we show that topic-level
framing and topic choice are different dimensions
of polarization. We now look at the specific terms

paring with zero: shooter’s identity & ideology (p < 0.05),

and types of grounding that are used as partisan
framing devices, contributing to polarization.

5.1 Methods

Partisan tokens. We estimate the partisanship
of tokens via their event-level log odds ratio of
Democrats relative to Republicans (based on the
vocabularies we create in Section 3.1). We com-
pare these estimates across events.12

Grounding. We study whether there is polar-
ization in which prior tragic events are refer-
enced in the context of a particular mass shoot-
ing. We compile a list of keywords representing
major events of mass violence in the US in the
past two decades and kept those that were men-
tioned at least 100 times by Democrat or Repub-
lican users. For all tweets for each event in our
dataset, we counted the mentions of past context
events. For example, in the following tweet posted
after Las Vegas: “Dozens of preventable deaths
should not be the cost of living in America. Stand
up to the #NRA. #LasVegasShooting #SandyHook
#Charleston”, Sandy Hook and Charleston are the
context events. Finally, we calculated the partisan
log odds ratio of each context event.

5.2 Results

We focus on the partisanship of the term “terror-
ist” and “crazy”, which exhibit differential pat-

12To compare the partisanship of tokens at the event- and
topic-level, we also z-score the log odds ratios (Monroe et al.,
2008) within events and topics; the most partisan tokens are
reported in Appendix F. The reason why we do not z-score
for the between-event comparison is because data verbosity
disproportionately affects the range of the values’ magni-
tudes. Note that the signs of values — which we focus on for
the cross-event comparison — are not affected by z-scoring.

terns across events based on the shooter’s race.13

“Terrorist” is always more likely to be used by
Democrats than Republicans in events where the
shooter is white, and the opposite is true when the
shooter is a person of color (Figure 8); “crazy” is
more likely used by Republicans if the shooter is
white than if they are a person of color and the
opposite is true (although the pattern is weaker)
when a shooter is white.

These findings support related work (Perea,
1997; Delgado and Stefancic, 2017) discussing bi-
nary conceptualization of race in the US, and its
influence in determining whether a shooter’s men-
tal health or aspects of their identity are discussed.
However, the fact that the influence of race flips
completely for Democrats and Republicans is a
striking result that calls for further exploration.

The partisanship of contextual grounding also
corroborates our finding that the shooter’s race in-
fluences how people conceptualize a certain event.
Our results in Figure 9 suggest a few key take-
aways: the two most frequently employed context
events are both highly partisan (Sandy Hook for
Democrats and 9/11 for Republicans); shootings
at schools and places of worship are more likely
to be brought up by Democrats; Democrats are
more likely to reference events with white shoot-
ers, while Republicans are more likely to reference
those with shooters who are people of color.

6 Affect

Affect is intimately tied to ideological reason-
ing (Redlawsk, 2002; Taber et al., 2009), and so
emotional expression represents another seman-
tic layer relevant to polarization (Iyengar et al.,
2012; Suhay, 2015). Others have shown that emo-
tion words can help detect political ideology on
Twitter (Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2017) and that emo-

(negative and positive, respectively) if we calculate the differ-
ences between the mean z-scores — grouped by the shooter’s
race — for all tokens in our joint vocabulary.

tive political tweets are more likely to be shared
(Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan, 2012). Here, we em-
ploy a lexicon-based approach to measure valence
(positive and negative) and five basic emotion cat-
egories (disgust, fear, trust, anger, and sadness).

6.1 Methods
Since word-affect associations are highly domain
dependent, we tailored an existing affect lexicon,
the NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad and Tur-
ney, 2013), to our domain via label propagation
(Hamilton et al., 2016).

Specifically, we stem all the words in the lexi-
con and select 8-10 representative stems per emo-
tion category that have an association with that
emotion in the context of mass shootings. For each
emotion category, we compute pairwise cosine
distances between the GloVe embedding of each
in-vocabulary stem and the representative stems
for that emotion, and include the 30 stems with
the lowest mean cosine distances. The resulting
lexicons can be found in Appendix E.

We use these lexicons to measure the parti-
sanship of each affect category. For each event
and each party we aggregate stem frequencies per
emotion category. We then calculate the partisan
log odds ratio of each category for each event.

6.2 Results
The log odds ratio of each affect category is shown
in Figure 10. These findings suggest that positive
sentiment, sadness and trust are more likely to be
expressed by Democrats across events, while fear
and disgust are more likely to be expressed by Re-
publicans, particularly when the shooter is a per-
son of color. Anger, trust and negative sentiment is
similarly likely to be expressed by both parties.14

Our results about fear and disgust accord with
existing literature on emotion and political ideol-
ogy: conservatives score higher than liberals on
subjective measures of fear (e.g. Jost et al., 2017;
Federico et al., 2009; Hibbing et al., 2014) and
disgust sensitivity is also associated with political
conservativism (e.g. Inbar et al., 2009, 2012).

7 Modality and Illocutionary Force

Modality is a lexical category concerned with
necessity and possibility (Kratzer, 2002; Fintel,

14p-values are calculated using a one sample t-test, com-
paring to zero: anger (p ⇡ 0.43), disgust (p ⇡ 0.06), fear
(p < 0.001), negative (p ⇡ .2), positive (p < 0.001), sad-
ness (p < 0.02), trust (p ⇡ 0.07).

2006). In the aftermath of a tragic event, people
seek solutions, a process that often involves re-
flecting on what should have happened or should
happen now or in the future (e.g. to prevent such
events). We hypothesize that the use of modals in
our data gives insight into the kind of (illocution-
ary) acts (Austin, 1962) the users are performing
via their tweets, such as calling for action, assign-
ing blame, expressing emotions, and stating facts.

7.1 Methods
We work with all forms of the four most frequent
necessity modals in our data — should, must, have
to and need to. For each, we quantify its partisan-
ship via its partisan log odds ratio. We also an-
notate a random sample of 200 tweets containing
modals to see whether they are indeed used in con-
texts that imply calls for change / action (e.g. ‘We
must have gun control!’) and / or to express the
user’s mental state about the event, such as despair
or disbelief (e.g. ‘Why do people have to die?’).

7.2 Results
Table 2 shows a random sample of tweets contain-
ing some form of either should, must, have to, or

need to. More collocations, as well as their parti-
sanship, can be found in Appendix H. These ex-
amples, as well as our annotation, support the hy-
pothesis that these modals are primarily used to
call for action. Of the 200 modal uses, ⇠78% ex-
press calls for change/action, ⇠40% express the
user’s mental state.15 We also compute the rep-
resentation pmx of each modal m in each topic
x 2 X via (fmx /

P

m

x0 )/(fx/
P

x02X fx0),
where fx is the number of tweets from topic x, and
fmx the number of those also containing m. We
find that that modals are over-represented in the
laws & policy topic (see Figure 11). This evidence
suggests that calls for policy change — especially
gun control, based on annotated samples — are a
dominant subset of calls for action.

The log odds ratio of modals shows that all of
them are more likely to be used by Democrats
across events: have to (mean:�.39, p < 0.001),

15Other uses are primarily epistemic ones (e.g. ‘The sus-
pect must be mentally ill’).

must (mean:�.3, p < 0.001), should (mean:�.18,
p < 0.01), need to (mean:�.18, p < 0.01) —
where Democrat and Republican log odds are neg-
ative and positive, respectively.16 A two-tailed t-
test shows that only should exhibits statistically
significant difference based on the shooter’s race
(p < 0.03), as it is even more likely to be used by
Democrats when the shooter is white.

To understand whether assigning blame in this
domain is a partisan propensity, we also study uses
of should have.17 The log odds of should have
(mean:�.22, p < 0.05) show that it is similarly
likely to be used by Democrats as should (p ⇡ 0.8
from two-tailed t-test). Interestingly the log odds
ratio of should have, unlike that of should, does
not differ significantly based on the shooter’s race
(p ⇡ 0.8 from two-tailed t-test). Moreover, we
did not find a significant difference in the parti-
sanship of should have nor any other modal based
on the administration (Obama or Trump) a shoot-
ing took place under, suggesting that Democrats
are more likely call for change and assign blame
even if their preferred party is in power.

8 Conclusion

We show that inspecting polarization on social me-
dia from various angles can shed light on salient
phenomena pertinent to group divisions. Apply-
ing the leave-out estimator of phrase partisanship
to data on mass shootings, we find that reactions
to these events are highly polarized politically.

To disentangle topic choice and topic-level
framing — two phenomena that contribute to po-
larization — we introduce a tweet-clustering ap-
proach. By sampling, requiring words in the vo-
cabulary to appear in multiple events and relying

16p-values are from one sample t-test, comparing to 0.
17On average across events, forms of should have consti-

tute 16% of the uses of should (SD=5%).

on the abstraction of a vector space model, we gen-
erate cohesive topic representations that are robust
to disparities among event-level vocabularies and
tweet counts. Human evaluation shows that our
method outperforms LDA-based approaches.

Our induced topics suggest that Republicans
preferentially discuss topics about the shooter’s
identity and ideology, investigation and news,
while Democrats preferentially discuss solidarity
and policy-related topics. We also find that the
setting and the shooter’s race interact with polar-
ization. For example, Democrats are more likely
to contextualize any mass shooting among school
shootings and call white shooters “terrorists” than
are Republicans, who in turn are more likely to
liken any shooting to other violent events per-
petrated by people of color — whom they are
more likely to call “terrorist” than are Democrats.
Moreover, Democrats are more likely to frame the
shooter as mentally ill when they are a person of
color and Republicans when they are white.

We also demonstrate that looking at affect and
illocutionary force can help us understand users’
polarized responses to these tragic events: Repub-
licans are more likely to express fear and disgust
than are Democrats, while Democrats are more
likely to express sadness and positive sentiment,
to make calls for action and assign blame.

Polarization is a multi-faceted phenomenon: in
this paper we present a set of measures to study
these different facets through the lens of language.
We show that these measures provide convergent
evidence, creating a clearer picture of the complex
ideological division permeating public life.

B.2 Partisan Assignment Sanity Check
In our sanity check, we exclude DC, as 1) it is not
an official US state and 2) there the population of
users (including politicians and media) is expected
to differ from the voting population. Figure 13
gives DC values.

Figure 13: This plot was generated the same way as
Figure 1, except that it also includes DC, which shows
that it is an outlier in our data due to the fact that there
are many Republican politicians and media outlets who
are affiliated on Twitter with DC, while DC’s voting
population tends to be Democratic.

B.3 Russian account presence
We find no substantial presence of Russian ac-
counts in the tweet set that we used for analysis,
after all pre-processing. We use the list of Rus-
sian accounts identified by Twitter and banned in
November 2017.18 This list is likely to be an un-
derestimate of the true presence of foreign influ-
ence, but it nevertheless provides some indication
of such activity. Table 4 contains a breakdown by
event; we exclude the events that occurred after
the accounts were banned. Orlando had one ac-
count that tweeted 115 times, and Vegas had 4 that
tweeted a total of 70 times.

News.

• HAPPENING NOW: Multiple people
wounded in shooting at Colorado Walmart

• 3 people are reported dead in #FtLaud-
erdaleshooting

• UPDATE: Baton Rouge 2 Officers confirmed
dead 7 officers have been shot in total. De-
tails are slowly coming in.

• San Francisco police responding to reports
of a shooting at a UPS facility, according to
multiple reports.

• BREAKING: Police confirm several fatali-
ties in #Annapolis newsroom shooting and
multiple people seriously injured. The sus-
pect is in custody. @SkyNewsAust

Investigation.

• Alleged synagogue shooter charged in deaths
of 11 people

• Michigan prosecutor: Suspect in Kalamazoo
rampage that killed 6 admitted to shootings.

• #COSshooting #PlannedParenthood It’s
over...suspect walked out and they appre-
hended him-no altercation in arrest. Suspect
turned himself in

• Capital Gazette shooter has been identified
as Jarrod W. Ramos, 38, who had previously
filed a defamation lawsuit against the paper
and a columnist in 2012.

• Waffle House gunman’s father facing charges
for GIVING him gun used to kill four

Shooter’s identity & ideology.

• HATE CRIME : Fresno Islamic Killer Re-
ferred to White People as “Devils”

• To say that extremist Muslims represent all
Muslims is like saying the gunmen in Col-
orado springs represents all Christians

• So who has #BatonRouge blamed for this
shooting Imperialist Obama BLM Movement
The Black Man Or the isolated mentally ill
white lone wolf

• Again, the Lafayette white killer is a “lone
wolf” but the Chattanooga Arab killer is an
entire religion. Aggressively insane troll
logic.

• Who is surprised that the San Bernardino
shooters were radicalized Muslims?

Victims & location.

• 12 Killed in California Shooting; Gunman
Targeted Bar in Thousand Oaks

• Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh: what we
know

• Navy Veteran Who Survived Afghanistan
Dies in Las Vegas Shooting

• Aaron Feis, who died in the mass shoot-
ing at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, was
praised by college recruiters and former play-
ers for helping dozens of high school athletes
land a chance to play in college.

• Texas church, site of deadly massacre, to be
demolished (Via WLTX 19)



2989

Laws & policy.

• This Parkland Tragedy was completely a
security meltdown in or security officials.
100% preventable. Gun laws had nothing
to do with this massacre. But gun control
could have diminish the carnage. Two dif-
ferent things...

• NRA allowed acts like #Chattanooga to be-
come commonplace. Their lobbying permits
people on the terror watch list to buy guns.
Remember that.

• I will not just #prayforsutherlandsprings, to-
day I vote for @PhilMurphyNJ and stronger
gun control laws in NJ #ElectionDay #Gun-
ControlNow

• Again the mental health flags were waving
about shooter in Santa Fe no one acted. By
now, if ones in charge cared and wanted to
protect students, Every School would have
had a security assessment and have hardened
access points. Can never stop these but can
make it harder.

• This is a mental health issue, security issue
AND a gun issue. Our government has taken
action on NONE of these to protect our stu-
dents. So clearly we are not being heard, and
our kids are being executed. What do we
do now? #EnoughIsEnough #DoSomething
#SantaFe #WeMustBeHeard

Solidarity.

• Our thoughts and prayers go out the vic-
tims and their families involved in the #Chat-
tanooga tragedy 2nite.

• Praying for the loved ones of the victims of
the shooting yesterday at the synagogue in
Pittsburgh.

• Our prayers go out to the victims, fami-
lies, friends & everyone affected in #San-
Bernardino #BeSafe #BeAware

• My heart goes out to the friends and family
of the victims in that parkland shooting :-(

• Our hearts goes to #UmpquaCommunityCol-
lege in the #oregonshooting #ChristCentere-
dEnt is praying 4 u #AllLivesMatter

Remembrance.

• @HarfordCC will honor victims
@UmpquaCC TODAY by observing a
National Moment of Silence 1:45PM in
Quad. Students should attend #IamUCC

• Photo: US flag flying at half-staff at White
House for victims of Roseburg, Ore., school
shooting

• More than 100 Romans gather in solidarity
against hate, honor victims of Orlando shoot-
ing

• Trump Denies Request To Lower Flags To
Honor Capital Gazette Shooting Victims
#DouchebagDon #CrookedTrump @FLO-
TUS @realDonaldTrump

• Live from #ChattanoogaShootings memorial
next on #11Alive

Other.

• I’m sure coming from you, this has nothing
to do with the Fresno shooting?

• I realize the dude from the Waffle House
shooting did a miraculous thing disarming
the shooter, but if I see the gaping wound on
his forearm one more time I’m gonna lose my
mind.

• The only thing that stops a bad guy with a
gun, is a good guy with a gun!!! #Kalamazoo

• The little clip I saw of what DT just said
about #PittsburghShooting #PittsburghSyna-
gogueShooting was ok (I guess)

• But when is someone gonna reassure me a
planned parenthood attack won’t happen

D Topic Model Evaluation

In the next two subsections we describe the tasks
which we crowdsourced to compare the three topic
models: MALLET, BTM and our embedding-
based model.

D.1 Word intrusion
Our word intrusion task is the same as is described
in Chang et al. (2009). Our topic-word distance
metric for MALLET and BTM is probability (we
use the exact topic-word matrix that these mod-
els output) and for our model it is cosine distance.
We created 2850 experimental items (i.e. sets of
words) with the following procedure:

1. Sample a model M , a k (between 6�10) and
a topic x ranging between 1� k.

2. For a given choice of M , k and x,

(a) sample 5 words among the closest 10
words to x.

(b) sample one word that is among the 5%
of the furthest words from x but also
among the 5% of the closest words to
another topic.

3. Shuffle the words.

Turkers were asked to pick the odd word out
among a set of words. Each MTurk HIT consisted
of 6 sets of words created via this procedure.

D.2 Tweet intrusion
Since we only assign one topic to each tweet, we
would like to evaluate how coherent the tweets are
that are assigned to the same topic. Therefore,
we define the tweet intrusion task analogously to
word intrusion. Our distance metric in this case is
the ratio of proximities (probability for MALLET
and BTM and cosine for our model) between the
closest topic and second closest topic — this value
quantifies the proximity to the closest topic as well
as how uniquely close that topic is (in contrast to
the second topic). We created 1800 experimental
items via the following procedure:

1. Sample a model M , a k (between 6�10) and
a topic x ranging between 1� k.

2. For a given choice of M , k and x,

(a) sample 3 tweets among the closest 1%
of tweets to x.

(b) sample one tweet that is among the 1%
of the furthest tweets from x but also
among the 1% of the closest tweets to
another topic.

3. Shuffle the tweets.

Turkers were asked to pick the odd tweet out from
these tweets. Each MTurk HIT consisted of three
sets of tweets.

G Personal Pronouns

Pronoun usage has been found to express differ-
ent degrees of self-reflection, awareness, inclusiv-
ity, perspective-taking, among several other psy-
chological phenomena, both on Twitter (Qiu et al.,
2012) and in various other domains (Hirsh and Pe-
terson, 2009; Yarkoni, 2010; Pennebaker, 2011).
We rely on these findings to treat pronouns as
proxies to measure polarization in terms of users’
personalization of the experience (1st person sg.),
inclusion (1st person pl.), deflection (3rd person).

G.1 Methods
To quantify the partisanship of personal pronouns,
we take the five personal pronoun categories in
LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001) (I, You, We,
SheHe, They) and then calculate their partisan log-
odds ratio.

G.2 Results
The log odds of pronouns suggest that first and
second person pronouns are significantly more
likely to be used by Democrats across the events,
while They is somewhat more likely to be used by
Democrats and SheHe is used similarly by the two
parties: I (mean:�.26, p < .001), We (mean:�.26,
p < .001), You (mean:�.13, p < 0.05), They
(mean:�.06, p < .1), SheHe (mean:.05, p ⇡ 0.36)
(see Figure 15).

The use of two pronouns is significantly differ-
ent based on the shooter’s race: SheHe and You are
both more likely to be used by Democrats when
the shooter is white and by Republicans if the
shooter is a person of color (p < 0.01 for SheHe
and p < 0.05 for You from two-tailed t test). The
pattern pertaining to SheHe might be partly ex-
plained by differential mentions of the president
(see Appendix F with the most partisan words),
since it so happens that most of the events where
the shooter was a person of color occurred un-
der Obama’s presidency while the ones where the
shooter was white predominantly occurred under
Trump’s presidency.

To better understand this result, we are again
interested to see if there is a link between pro-
noun usage and topic preferences — we use the
same procedure to measure the representation of
pronouns in topics as in the case of modals. Our
findings (see Figure 15) show that first I pre-
dominantly occurs in solidarity and other, which,
coupled with previous findings about these topics

being preferred by Democrats and about affect,
suggest that Democrats in our dataset are more
likely to personalize their tweets and write about
their own mental state and feelings towards the
event and the victims. Similarly We is overrep-
resented in laws & policy, also a topic that is pre-
ferred by Democrats, which, building on our re-
sults about modals (Section 7.2), provide evidence
that Democrats are more likely to call for collec-
tive action.

SheHe, on the other hand, are most frequent
in investigation, shooter’s identity & ideology and
victims & location — topics that are more likely
to be discussed by Republicans. This result, sup-
ported by our finding about affect, suggests that
Republicans in this domain are more likely to au-
thor tweets that focus on a third person (e.g. the
shooter).

H Modal Collocations
We study the subjects and complements of modals
and their partisanship to get a better view of how
these modals are used. We calculate the z-scored
partisan log odds ratio of the collocations (subject
+ modal + complement constructions) at the event-
and modal-level. We keep all collocations that are
more likely to be used by Democrats or Republi-
cans by at least .5 SD of the event- and modal-level
log odds ratios (in other words, whose z-score has
an absolute value that is at least .5). In the list be-
low, we show those collocations that are partisan
in the same direction (Democrat or Republican) in
at least three events.

Note that before calculating the log odds ra-
tio, we replace contracted forms with their non-
contracted form (e.g. “shouldn’t” with “should
not”, “should’ve” with “should have”). The num-
ber following the collocations is the number of
events for which a particular term is partisan to-
wards a given party. Often when a collocation
seems ungrammatical, it is because it is comes
from a question (e.g. “long must we” ! “how
long must we”).

Note that the patterns in the collocations ac-
cord with the findings discussed in the paper.
Democrats are more likely to use modals to call for
collective and proactive action (e.g. “we must do”,
“we have to do”, “something needs to be done”,
“we need to act”) and also to express emotion (e.g.
“[why do] people have to die”, “[why do] people
need to die”) than Republicans. Republicans are
more likely to use modals epistemically (e.g. “it
must have been”) and in other, idiomatic, senses
that do not imply necessity (e.g. “it has to do
[with]”, “I have to say”, “I must say”). Republi-
cans are less likely to use modals in contexts with
first person plural subjects (“we”) than Democrats,
but are more likely to use “we” in contexts where
the modal’s prejacent implies “stopping” some-
thing rather than “doing” something (e.g. “we
must ban”, “we must protect”, “we should ban”,
“we need to protect”).
