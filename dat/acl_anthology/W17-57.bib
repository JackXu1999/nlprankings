    abstract = "We propose \textit{prefix constraints}, a novel method to enforce constraints on target sentences in neural machine translation. It places a sequence of special tokens at the beginning of target sentence (target prefix), while side constraints places a special token at the end of source sentence (source suffix). Prefix constraints can be predicted from source sentence jointly with target sentence, while side constraints (Sennrich et al., 2016) must be provided by the user or predicted by some other methods. In both methods, special tokens are designed to encode arbitrary features on target-side or metatextual information. We show that prefix constraints are more flexible than side constraints and can be used to control the behavior of neural machine translation, in terms of output length, bidirectional decoding, domain adaptation, and unaligned target word generation.",

However, manually constructed large-scale parallel corpora are not freely available in many language pairs. In previous studies, training data have been expanded using a pseudo-parallel corpus obtained using machine translation of the monolingual corpus in the target language. However, in low-resource language pairs in which only low-accuracy machine translation systems can be used, translation quality is reduces when a pseudo-parallel corpus is used naively. To improve machine translation performance with low-resource language pairs, we propose a method to expand the training data effectively via filtering the pseudo-parallel corpus using a quality estimation based on back-translation. As a result of experiments with three language pairs using small, medium, and large parallel corpora, language pairs with fewer training data filtered out more sentence pairs and improved BLEU scores more significantly.",

This problem becomes even more serious when translating patent documents, which contain many technical terms that are observed infrequently. Long et al.(2017) proposed to select phrases that contain out-of-vocabulary words using the statistical approach of branching entropy. The selected phrases are then replaced with tokens during training and post-translated by the phrase translation table of SMT. In this paper, we apply the method proposed by Long et al. (2017) to the WAT 2017 Japanese-Chinese and Japanese-English patent datasets. Evaluation on Japanese-to-Chinese, Chinese-to-Japanese, Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese patent sentence translation proved the effectiveness of phrases selected with branching entropy, where the NMT model of Long et al.(2017) achieves a substantial improvement over a baseline NMT model without the technique proposed by Long et al.(2017).",

One of the major drawback of NMT is under-translation and over-translation. On the other hand, SMT infrequently makes such translations. So, using reranking of n-best NMT outputs by the SMT output, discarding such translations can be expected. We can improve BLEU score from 46.03 to 47.08 by this technique in JPCzh-ja task.",
