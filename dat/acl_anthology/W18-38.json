The NooJ program is an alternative to statistical methods commonly used in NLP: all PV are listed in a dictionary and then located by means of a PV grammar in both continuous and discontinuous format. Results are then refined with a series of dictionaries, disambiguating grammars, and other linguistics recourses. The main advantage of such a program is that all PV can be identified in any corpus. The only drawback is that PV not listed in the dictionary (e.g., archaic forms, recent neologisms) are not identified; however, new PV can easily be added to the electronic dictionary, which is freely available to all.","pages":"18--27","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-3804","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Linguistic Resources for Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"W18-3805","title":"Designing a {C}roatian Aspectual Derivatives Dictionary: Preliminary Stages","authors":["Kocijan, Kristina","{\\v{S}}ojat, Kre{\\v{s}}imir","Poljak, Dario"],"emails":["krkocijan@ffzg.hr","ksojat@ffzg.hr","dpoljak@ffzg.hr"],"author_id":["kristina-kocijan","kresimir-sojat","dario-poljak"],"abstract":"The paper focusses on derivationally connected verbs in Croatian, i.e. on verbs that share the same lexical morpheme and are derived from other verbs via prefixation, suffixation and\/or stem alternations.

The category {`}adjective{'} has been chosen on account of its lower frequency of occurrence in texts written in Spanish, and particularly in the Argentine Rioplatense variety, and with the aim of developing strategies to increase its use. In addition, the features that the adjective shares with other grammatical categories render it extremely productive and provide elements that enrich the learners{'} proficiency. The reference corpus contains the front pages of the Argentinian newspaper Clar{\\'\\i}n related to an emblematic historical moment, whose starting point is 24 March 1976, when a military coup began, and covers a thirty year period until 24 March 2006. It can be seen how the term desaparecido emerges with all its cultural and social charge, providing a context which allows an approach to Rioplatense Spanish from a more comprehensive perspective.

We present an augmentation pipeline for existing MT approaches, like Phrase Based MT (Moses) and Neural MT, to improve the translation of code-mixed text.
