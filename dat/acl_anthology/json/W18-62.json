However, these embeddings might map words with opposite polarities, to vectors close to each other.

For this task, we rely on the universality of emojis to auto-label a large number of French tweets using a small set of positive and negative emojis. Finally, we apply a transfer learning approach to refine the network weights with a small-size manually-labeled training data set. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of this approach on French sentiment classification using benchmark data sets from SemEval 2016 competition.

Here, for the first time, we propose a shared task where systems have to predict the emotions in a large automatically labeled dataset of tweets without access to words denoting emotions. Based on this intention, we call this the Implicit Emotion Shared Task (IEST) because the systems have to infer the emotion mostly from the context.

This method converts the sentiment classification problem into image classification problem by projecting texts into images and then applying CNN models for classification. Text features are extracted automatically from the generated Super Characters images, hence there is no need of any explicit step of embedding the words or characters into numerical vector representations. Experimental results on large social media corpus show that the Super Characters method consistently outperforms other methods for sentiment classification and topic classification tasks on ten large social media datasets of millions of contents in four different languages, including Chinese, Japanese,Korean and English.","pages":"309--315","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-6245","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-6245","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis"},{"id":"W18-6246","title":"Learning Comment Controversy Prediction in Web Discussions Using Incidentally Supervised Multi-Task {CNN}s","authors":["Rethmeier, Nils","H{\\\"u}bner, Marc","Hennig, Leonhard"],"emails":["nils.rethmeier@dfki.de","marc.h{\\\"u}bner@dfki.de","leonhard.hennig@dfki.de"],"author_id":["nils-rethmeier","marc-hubner","leonhard-hennig"],"abstract":"Comments on web news contain controversies that manifest as inter-group agreement-conflicts.

Most existing works have investigated hirability from the perspective of nonverbal behavior, with verbal content receiving little interest. In this study, we leverage the advances in deep-learning based text representation techniques (like word embedding) in natural language processing to investigate the relationship between verbal content and perceived hirability ratings. To this end, we use 292 conversational video resumes from YouTube, develop a computational framework to automatically extract various representations of verbal content, and evaluate them in a regression task. We obtain a best performance of R{\\mbox{$^2$}} = 0.23 using GloVe, and R{\\mbox{$^2$}} = 0.22 using Word2Vec representations for manual and automatically transcribed texts respectively. Our inference results indicate the feasibility of using deep learning based verbal content representation in inferring hirability scores from online conversational video resumes.","pages":"322--327","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-6247","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-6247","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis"},{"id":"W18-6248","title":"Predicting Adolescents{'} Educational Track from Chat Messages on {D}utch Social Media","authors":["Hilte, Lisa","Daelemans, Walter","Vandekerckhove, Reinhild"],"emails":["lisa.hilte@uantwerpen.be","walter.daelemans@uantwerpen.be","reinhild.vandekerckhove@uantwerpen.be"],"author_id":["lisa-hilte","walter-daelemans","reinhild-vandekerckhove"],"abstract":"We aim to predict Flemish adolescents{'} educational track based on their Dutch social media writing.

Many of the most informative features are character n-grams containing specific occurrences of chatspeak phenomena such as emoticons.

In the literature, the difficulties associated with Arabizi sentiment analysis have been underestimated, principally due to the complexity of Arabizi. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically classify sentiments of Arabizi messages into positives or negatives. In the proposed approach, Arabizi messages are first transliterated into Arabic. Afterwards, we automatically classify the sentiment of the transliterated corpus using an automatically annotated corpus. For corpus validation, shallow machine learning algorithms such as Support Vectors Machine (SVM) and Naive Bays (NB) are used. Simulations results demonstrate the outperformance of NB algorithm over all others. The highest achieved F1-score is up to 78{\\%} and 76{\\%} for manually and automatically transliterated dataset respectively. Ongoing work is aimed at improving the transliterator module and annotated sentiment dataset.","pages":"335--341","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-6249","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-6249","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis"},{"id":"W18-6250","title":"{UBC}-{NLP} at {IEST} 2018: Learning Implicit Emotion With an Ensemble of Language Models","authors":["Alhuzali, Hassan","Elaraby, Mohamed","Abdul-Mageed, Muhammad"],"emails":["halhuzali@alumni.ubc.ca","mohamed.elaraby@alumni.ubc.ca","muhammad.mageeed@ubc.ca"],"author_id":["hassan-alhuzali","mohamed-elaraby","muhammad-abdul-mageed"],"abstract":"We describe UBC-NLP contribution to IEST-2018, focused at learning implicit emotion in Twitter data.
