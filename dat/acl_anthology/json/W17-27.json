The approach is able to run online, as new articles are added, processing 4 million news articles from 20 news sources, and extracting 80000 major stories, some of which span several years. The visual interface consists of lanes of timelines, each annotated with information that is deemed important for the story, including extracted quotations. The working system allows a user to search and navigate 8 years of story information.","pages":"1--9","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-2701","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-2701","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Events and Stories in the News Workshop"},{"id":"W17-2702","title":"Detecting Changes in Twitter Streams using Temporal Clusters of Hashtags","authors":["Wang, Yunli","Goutte, Cyril"],"emails":["yunli.wang@nrc.ca","cyril.goutte@nrc.ca"],"author_id":["yunli-wang","cyril-goutte"],"abstract":"Detecting events from social media data has important applications in public security, political issues, and public health. Many studies have focused on detecting specific or unspecific events from Twitter streams. However, not much attention has been paid to detecting changes, and their impact, in online conversations related to an event. We propose methods for detecting such changes, using clustering of temporal profiles of hashtags, and three change point detection algorithms. The methods were tested on two Twitter datasets: one covering the 2014 Ottawa shooting event, and one covering the Sochi winter Olympics. We compare our approach to a baseline consisting of detecting change from raw counts in the conversation. We show that our method produces large gains in change detection accuracy on both datasets.","pages":"10--14","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-2702","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-2702","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Events and Stories in the News Workshop"},{"id":"W17-2703","title":"Event Detection Using Frame-Semantic Parser","authors":["Spiliopoulou, Evangelia","Hovy, Eduard","Mitamura, Teruko"],"emails":["espiliop@cs.cmu.edu","hovy@cmu.edu","teruko@cs.cmu.edu"],"author_id":["evangelia-spiliopoulou","eduard-hovy","teruko-mitamura"],"abstract":"Recent methods for Event Detection focus on Deep Learning for automatic feature generation and feature ranking.

Shared arguments of event knowledge encode patterns of role shifting in successive events.

This paper focuses on the second stage of this framework, and proposes a method to improve the shared argument identification of related event pairs. We constructed a gold dataset for shared argument learning.

Computational work in this area has approached this via two different routes: by focusing on acquiring a knowledge base of common causal relations between events, or by attempting to understand a particular story or macro-event, along with its storyline. In this position paper, we focus on knowledge acquisition approach and claim that newswire is a relatively poor source for learning fine-grained causal relations between everyday events. We describe experiments using an unsupervised method to learn causal relations between events in the narrative genres of first-person narratives and film scene descriptions. We show that our method learns fine-grained causal relations, judged by humans as likely to be causal over 80{\\%} of the time. We also demonstrate that the learned event pairs do not exist in publicly available event-pair datasets extracted from newswire.","pages":"52--58","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-2708","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-2708","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Events and Stories in the News Workshop"},{"id":"W17-2709","title":"On the Creation of a Security-Related Event Corpus","authors":["Atkinson, Martin","Piskorski, Jakub","Tanev, Hristo","Zavarella, Vanni"],"emails":["martin.atkinson@ec.europa.eu","jakub.piskorski@ec.europa.eu","hristo.tanev@ec.europa.eu","vanni.zavarella@ec.europa.eu"],"author_id":["martin-atkinson","jakub-piskorski","hristo-tanev","vanni-zavarella"],"abstract":"This paper reports on an effort of creating a corpus of structured information on security-related events automatically extracted from on-line news, part of which has been manually curated.

In the last few years, more inductive approaches have emerged, seeking to discover unknown event types and roles in raw text. The main recent efforts use probabilistic generative models, as in topic modeling, which are formally concise but do not always yield stable or easily interpretable results. We argue that event schema induction can benefit from greater structure in the process and in linguistic features that distinguish words{'} functions and themes. To maximize our use of limited data, we reverse the typical schema induction steps and introduce new similarity measures, building an intuitive process for inducing the structure of unknown events.","pages":"66--76","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-2710","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-2710","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Events and Stories in the News Workshop"},{"id":"W17-2711","title":"The Event {S}tory{L}ine Corpus: A New Benchmark for Causal and Temporal Relation Extraction","authors":["Caselli, Tommaso","Vossen, Piek"],"emails":["t.caselli@vu.nl","p.t.j.m.vossen@vu.nl"],"author_id":["tommaso-caselli","piek-vossen"],"abstract":"This paper reports on the Event StoryLine Corpus (ESC) v1.0, a new benchmark dataset for the temporal and causal relation detection.

By unifying the FrameNet, VerbNet, Automatic Content Extraction, and Rich Entities, Relations and Events resources, the ontology serves as a shared hub for the disparate annotation schemas and therefore enables the combination of SRL training data into a larger, more diverse corpus. By adding temporal and causal relational information not found in any of the independent resources, the ontology facilitates reasoning on and across documents, revealing relationships between events that come together in temporal and causal chains to build more complex scenarios.
