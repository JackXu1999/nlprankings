We introduce a writing task that contains the essential challenges of generating meaningful figurative language and can be evaluated. We investigate how to find metaphorical connections between abstract themes and concrete domains by asking people to write four-line poems on a given metaphor, such as {``}death is a rose{''} or {``}anger is wood{''}. We find that only 21{\\%} of poems successfully make a metaphorical connection. We present five alternate ways people respond to the prompt and release our dataset of 100 categorized poems. We suggest opportunities for computational approaches.","pages":"1--6","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-0901","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-0901","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans, Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Figurative Language Processing"},{"id":"W18-0902","title":"Linguistic Features of Sarcasm and Metaphor Production Quality","authors":["Skalicky, Stephen","Crossley, Scott"],"emails":["scskalicky@gmail.com","scrossley@gsu.edu"],"author_id":["stephen-skalicky","scott-crossley"],"abstract":"Using linguistic features to detect figurative language has provided a deeper in-sight into figurative language. The purpose of this study is to assess whether linguistic features can help explain differences in quality of figurative language. In this study a large corpus of metaphors and sarcastic responses are collected from human subjects and rated for figurative language quality based on theoretical components of metaphor, sarcasm, and creativity. Using natural language processing tools, specific linguistic features related to lexical sophistication and semantic cohesion were used to predict the human ratings of figurative language quality.

Computational approaches to metaphor identification have largely relied on heuristic based models or feature-based machine learning, using hand-crafted lexical resources coupled with basic syntactic information. However, recent work has shown the predictive power of syntactic constructions in determining metaphoric source and target domains (Sullivan 2013). Our work intends to explore syntactic constructions and their relation to metaphoric language. We undertake a corpus-based analysis of predicate-argument constructions and their metaphoric properties, and attempt to effectively represent syntactic constructions as features for metaphor processing, both in identifying source and target domains and in distinguishing metaphoric words from non-metaphoric.","pages":"17--26","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-0903","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-0903","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans, Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Figurative Language Processing"},{"id":"W18-0904","title":"Literal, Metphorical or Both?
