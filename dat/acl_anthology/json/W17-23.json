We then score this lattice according to various features, and attempt to determine whether the anomalous production represented a phonemic error or a genuine neologism. This approach has the potential to be expanded to consider other types of paraphasic errors, and could be applied to a wide variety of screening and therapeutic applications.","pages":"1--8","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-2301","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-2301","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada,","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"{B}io{NLP} 2017"},{"id":"W17-2302","title":"Extracting Drug-Drug Interactions with Attention {CNN}s","authors":["Asada, Masaki","Miwa, Makoto","Sasaki, Yutaka"],"emails":["sd17402@toyota-ti.ac.jp","makoto-miwa@toyota-ti.ac.jp","yutaka.sasaki@toyota-ti.ac.jp"],"author_id":["masaki-asada","makoto-miwa","yutaka-sasaki"],"abstract":"We propose a novel attention mechanism for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) extraction model.

Different approaches have different strengths: some are precision-oriented, some recall-oriented; some better at considering context but more prone to hallucination.

The proposed method relies on a distributional semantics approach, which generates initial vectors for each of the extracted terms. Then these vectors are embedded in the vector space constructed from the structure of the ontology. This embedding is carried out by training a linear model. Finally, we apply a distance calculation to determine the proximity between vectors of terms and vectors of concepts and thus to assign ontology labels to terms. We have evaluated the quality of these representations for a normalization task by using the concepts of an ontology as semantic labels. Normalization of terms is an important step to extract a part of the information containing in texts, but the vector space generated might find other applications.

We classify questions according to the computational strategy (rule-based or other) needed for looking up data in the clinical record. We compare {`}traditional{'} machine learning methods (Gaussian and Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines) and a neural network classifier (FastText). We obtained the best results with the SVM using semantic annotations, whereas the neural classifier achieved promising results without it.","pages":"333--341","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-2343","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-2343","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada,","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"{B}io{NLP} 2017"},{"id":"W17-2344","title":"Assessing the performance of {O}lelo, a real-time biomedical question answering application","authors":["Neves, Mariana","Eckert, Fabian","Folkerts, Hendrik","Uflacker, Matthias"],"emails":["mariana.neves@hpi.de","","",""],"author_id":["mariana-neves","fabian-eckert","hendrik-folkerts","matthias-uflacker"],"abstract":"Question answering (QA) can support physicians and biomedical researchers to find answers to their questions in the scientific literature. Such systems process large collections of documents in real time and include many natural language processing (NLP) procedures.

In this work, we present an evaluation of our system on the the fifth BioASQ challenge. We participated with the current state of the application and with an extension based on semantic role labeling that we are currently investigating. In addition to the BioASQ evaluation, we compared our system to other on-line biomedical QA systems in terms of the response time and the quality of the answers.","pages":"342--350","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-2344","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-2344","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada,","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"{B}io{NLP} 2017"},{"id":"W17-2345","title":"Clinical Event Detection with Hybrid Neural Architecture","authors":["Maharana, Adyasha","Yetisgen, Meliha"],"emails":["adyasha@uw.edu","melihay@uw.edu"],"author_id":["adyasha-maharana","meliha-yetisgen-yildiz"],"abstract":"Event detection from clinical notes has been traditionally solved with rule based and statistical natural language processing (NLP) approaches that require extensive domain knowledge and feature engineering.

Prior work in this domain has used manually constructed keyword sets to detect medical events. In this work, our aim is to perform medical event detection using minimal supervision in order to develop a more general timeline construction system.

Performance comparison across these two approaches is conducted in the form of sentence-level evaluation and state-of-the-art methods for both approaches are evaluated. The experiments are done on two data sets consisting of Finnish clinical text, manually annotated with respect to the topics pain and acute confusion. Our results suggest that the mention-level named-entity recognition approach outperforms sentence-level classification overall, but the latter approach still manages to achieve the best prediction scores on several annotation classes.","pages":"365--372","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-2347","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-2347","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada,","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"{B}io{NLP} 2017"},{"id":"W17-2348","title":"A Multi-strategy Query Processing Approach for Biomedical Question Answering: {USTB}{\\_}{PRIR} at {B}io{ASQ} 2017 Task 5{B}","authors":["Jin, Zan-Xia","Zhang, Bo-Wen","Fang, Fan","Zhang, Le-Le","Yin, Xu-Cheng"],"emails":["","bowenzhang@xs.ustb.edu.cn","","","xuchengyin@ustb.edu.cn"],"author_id":["zan-xia-jin","bo-wen-zhang","fan-fang","le-le-zhang","xu-cheng-yin"],"abstract":"This paper describes the participation of USTB{\\_}PRIR team in the 2017 BioASQ 5B on question answering, including document retrieval, snippet retrieval, and concept retrieval task.
