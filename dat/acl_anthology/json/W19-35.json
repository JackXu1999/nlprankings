Moderators try to limit this problem by implementing more and more refined comment filters, but toxic users are constantly finding new ways to circumvent them. Our hypothesis is that while modifying toxic content and keywords to fool filters can be easy, hiding sentiment is harder. In this paper, we explore various aspects of sentiment detection and their correlation to toxicity, and use our results to implement a toxicity detection tool. We then test how adding the sentiment information helps detect toxicity in three different real-world datasets, and incorporate subversion to these datasets to simulate a user trying to circumvent the system. Our results show sentiment information has a positive impact on toxicity detection.","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-3501","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-3501","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Abusive Language Online"},{"id":"W19-3502","title":"Exploring Deep Multimodal Fusion of Text and Photo for Hate Speech Classification","authors":["Yang, Fan","Peng, Xiaochang","Ghosh, Gargi","Shilon, Reshef","Ma, Hao","Moore, Eider","Predovic, Goran"],"emails":["flymonkey@fb.com","xiaochang@fb.com","gghosh@fb.com","reshefshilon@fb.com","haom@fb.com","idr@fb.com","predovic@fb.com"],"author_id":["fan-yang","xiaochang-peng","gargi-ghosh","reshef-shilon","hao-ma","eider-moore","goran-predovic"],"abstract":"Interactions among users on social network platforms are usually positive, constructive and insightful. However, sometimes people also get exposed to objectionable content such as hate speech, bullying, and verbal abuse etc. Most social platforms have explicit policy against hate speech because it creates an environment of intimidation and exclusion, and in some cases may promote real-world violence. As users{'} interactions on today{'}s social networks involve multiple modalities, such as texts, images and videos, in this paper we explore the challenge of automatically identifying hate speech with deep multimodal technologies, extending previous research which mostly focuses on the text signal alone. We present a number of fusion approaches to integrate text and photo signals. We show that augmenting text with image embedding information immediately leads to a boost in performance, while applying additional attention fusion methods brings further improvement.","pages":"11--18","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-3502","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-3502","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Abusive Language Online"},{"id":"W19-3503","title":"Detecting harassment in real-time as conversations develop","authors":["Stoop, Wessel","Kunneman, Florian","van den Bosch, Antal","Miller, Ben"],"emails":["w.stoop@let.ru.nl","f.kunneman@let.ru.nl","antal.van.den.bosch@meertens.knaw.nl","b.j.miller@emory.edu"],"author_id":["wessel-stoop","florian-kunneman","antal-van-den-bosch","ben-miller"],"abstract":"We developed a machine-learning-based method to detect video game players that harass teammates or opponents in chat earlier in the conversation.

To provide means for mitigating the potential negative effects on course participation and learning, we developed an automated classifier for identifying communication that show linguistic patterns associated with hostility in online forums. In so doing, we employ several well-established automated text analysis tools and build on the common practices for handling highly imbalanced datasets and reducing the sensitivity to overfitting.

We introduce a novel partitioning approach for characterizing user polarization based on their distribution of participation across interest subreddits. We then use automated techniques for capturing framing to examine how users with different viewpoints discuss moderation issues, finding that right-leaning users invoked censorship while left-leaning users highlighted inconsistencies on how content policies are applied.

In the last years, different datasets were published, mainly for English. In this paper, we present a new dataset for Portuguese, which has not been in focus so far. The dataset is composed of 5,668 tweets. For its annotation, we defined two different schemes used by annotators with different levels of expertise. Firstly, non-experts annotated the tweets with binary labels ({`}hate{'} vs. {`}no-hate{'}). Secondly, expert annotators classified the tweets following a fine-grained hierarchical multiple label scheme with 81 hate speech categories in total. The inter-annotator agreement varied from category to category, which reflects the insight that some types of hate speech are more subtle than others and that their detection depends on personal perception. This hierarchical annotation scheme is the main contribution of the presented work, as it facilitates the identification of different types of hate speech and their intersections. To demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset, we carried a baseline classification experiment with pre-trained word embeddings and LSTM on the binary classified data, with a state-of-the-art outcome.","pages":"94--104","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-3510","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-3510","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Abusive Language Online"},{"id":"W19-3511","title":"A System to Monitor Cyberbullying based on Message Classification and Social Network Analysis","authors":["Menini, Stefano","Moretti, Giovanni","Corazza, Michele","Cabrio, Elena","Tonelli, Sara","Villata, Serena"],"emails":["menini@fbk.eu","moretti@fbk.eu","michele.corazza@inria.fr","elena.cabrio@unice.fr","satonelli@fbk.eu","serena.villata@unice.fr"],"author_id":["stefano-menini","giovanni-moretti","michele-corazza","elena-cabrio","sara-tonelli","serena-villata"],"abstract":"Social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram face a surge in cyberbullying phenomena against young users and need to develop scalable computational methods to limit the negative consequences of this kind of abuse.

We describe the empirical foundations for bootstrapping such a low-end lexicon for German by starting from manually supplied lexicographic categorizations of a small seed set of rough and vulgar lexical items and automatically enlarging this set by means of distributional semantics. We then determine the degrees of obscenity for the full set of all acquired lexical items by letting crowdworkers comparatively assess their pejorative grade using best-worst scaling. This semi-automatically enriched lexicon already comprises 3,300 lexical items and incorporates 33,000 vulgarity ratings.
