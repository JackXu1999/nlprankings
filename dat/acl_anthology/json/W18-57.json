To build a dialogue scenario, we analyze the discourse tree (DT) of an initial query of a customer support dialogue that is frequently complex and multi-sentence. We then enforce rhetorical agreement between DT of the initial query and that of the answers, requests and responses. The chat bot finds answers, which are not only relevant by topic but also suitable for a given step of a conversation and match the question by style, communication means, experience level and other domain-independent attributes. We evaluate a performance of proposed algorithm in car repair domain and observe a 5 to 10{\\%} improvement for sin-gle and three-step dialogues respectively, in comparison with baseline approaches to dialogue management.","pages":"17--23","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5703","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5703","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 {EMNLP} Workshop {SCAI}: The 2nd International Workshop on Search-Oriented Conversational {AI}"},{"id":"W18-5704","title":"A Methodology for Evaluating Interaction Strategies of Task-Oriented Conversational Agents","authors":["Guerini, Marco","Falcone, Sara","Magnini, Bernardo"],"emails":["guerini@fbk.eu","sfalcone@fbk.eu","magnini@fbk.eu"],"author_id":["marco-guerini","sara-falcone","bernardo-magnini"],"abstract":"In task-oriented conversational agents, more attention has been usually devoted to assessing task effectiveness (i.e. quality of service), rather than to how the task is achieved (i.e. quality of experience).","pages":"24--32","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5704","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5704","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 {EMNLP} Workshop {SCAI}: The 2nd International Workshop on Search-Oriented Conversational {AI}"},{"id":"W18-5705","title":"A Reinforcement Learning-driven Translation Model for Search-Oriented Conversational Systems","authors":["Aissa, Wafa","Soulier, Laure","Denoyer, Ludovic"],"emails":["wafa.aissa@lip6.fr","laure.soulier@lip6.fr","ludovic.denoyer@lip6.fr"],"author_id":["wafa-aissa","laure-soulier","ludovic-denoyer"],"abstract":"Search-oriented conversational systems rely on information needs expressed in natural language (NL).

In a conversational setting, an additional dimension of diversity matters: an engaging response generation system should be able to output responses that are diverse and interesting. Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models have been shown to be very effective for response generation. However, dialogue responses generated by Seq2Seq models tend to have low diversity. In this paper, we review known sources and existing approaches to this low-diversity problem. We also identify a source of low diversity that has been little studied so far, namely model over-confidence. We sketch several directions for tackling model over-confidence and, hence, the low-diversity problem, including confidence penalties and label smoothing.","pages":"81--86","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5712","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5712","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 {EMNLP} Workshop {SCAI}: The 2nd International Workshop on Search-Oriented Conversational {AI}"},{"id":"W18-5713","title":"Retrieve and Refine: Improved Sequence Generation Models For Dialogue","authors":["Weston, Jason","Dinan, Emily","Miller, Alexander"],"emails":["jase@fb.com","edinan@fb.com","ahm@fb.com"],"author_id":["jason-weston","emily-dinan","alexander-miller"],"abstract":"Sequence generation models for dialogue are known to have several problems: they tend to produce short, generic sentences that are uninformative and unengaging.
