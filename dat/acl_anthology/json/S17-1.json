Previous work have shown that this strategy works more reliably for certain types of analogical word relationships than for others, but these studies have not offered a convincing account for why this is the case. We arrive at such an account through an experiment that targets a wide variety of analogy questions and defines a baseline condition to more accurately measure the efficacy of our system. We find that the most reliably solvable analogy categories involve either 1) the application of a morpheme with clear syntactic effects, 2) male{--}female alternations, or 3) named entities. These broader types do not pattern cleanly along a syntactic{--}semantic divide. We suggest instead that their commonality is distributional, in that the difference between the distributions of two words in any given pair encompasses a relatively small number of word types. Our study offers a needed explanation for why analogy tests succeed and fail where they do and provides nuanced insight into the relationship between word distributions and the theoretical linguistic domains of syntax and semantics.","pages":"1--11","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/S17-1001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/S17-1001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 6th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*{SEM} 2017)"},{"id":"S17-1002","title":"Learning Antonyms with Paraphrases and a Morphology-Aware Neural Network","authors":["Rajana, Sneha","Callison-Burch, Chris","Apidianaki, Marianna","Shwartz, Vered"],"emails":["srajana@seas.upenn.edu","ccb@seas.upenn.edu","marapi@seas.upenn.edu","vered1986@gmail.com"],"author_id":["sneha-rajana","chris-callison-burch","marianna-apidianaki","vered-shwartz"],"abstract":"Recognizing and distinguishing antonyms from other types of semantic relations is an essential part of language understanding systems.

Attempts to apply the scheme to adpositions and case markers in other languages, as well as some problematic cases in English, have led us to reconsider the assumption that an adposition{'}s lexical contribution is equivalent to the role\/relation that it mediates. Our proposal is to embrace the potential for construal in adposition use, expressing such phenomena directly at the token level to manage complexity and avoid sense proliferation. We suggest a framework to represent both the scene role and the adposition{'}s lexical function so they can be annotated at scale{---}supporting automatic, statistical processing of domain-general language{---}and discuss how this representation would allow for a simpler inventory of labels.","pages":"178--188","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/S17-1022","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/S17-1022","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 6th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*{SEM} 2017)"},{"id":"S17-1023","title":"Issues of Mass and Count: Dealing with {`}Dual-Life{'} Nouns","authors":["Kiss, Tibor","Pelletier, Francis Jeffry","Husi{\\'c}, Halima","Poppek, Johanna"],"emails":["tibor@linguistics.rub.de","francisp@ualberta.ca","husic@linguistics.rub.de","poppek@linguistics.rub.de"],"author_id":["tibor-kiss","francis-jeffry-pelletier","halima-husic1","johanna-poppek"],"abstract":"The topics of mass and count have been studied for many decades in philosophy (e.g., Quine, 1960; Pelletier, 1975), linguistics (e.g., McCawley, 1975; Allen, 1980; Krifka, 1991) and psychology (e.g., Middleton et al, 2004; Barner et al, 2009).

We believe that HRL are more expressive than is necessary to represent semantic graphs and we propose the use of Regular Graph Languages (RGL; Courcelle 1991), which is a subfamily of HRL, as a possible alternative.

Our approach revolves around a novel integration between a predictive embedding model and an Indian Buffet Process posterior regularizer.

A common approach is to exploit existing knowledge to learn linguistic patterns expressing the target relation and use these patterns for extracting new relation mentions. Deriving relation patterns automatically usually results in large numbers of candidates, which need to be filtered to derive a subset of patterns that reliably extract correct relation mentions. We address the pattern selection task by exploiting the knowledge represented by entailment graphs, which capture semantic relationships holding among the learned pattern candidates. This is motivated by the fact that a pattern may not express the target relation explicitly, but still be useful for extracting instances for which the relation holds, because its meaning entails the meaning of the target relation. We evaluate the usage of both automatically generated and gold-standard entailment graphs in a relation extraction scenario and present favorable experimental results, exhibiting the benefits of structuring and selecting patterns based on entailment graphs.","pages":"220--229","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/S17-1026","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/S17-1026","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 6th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*{SEM} 2017)"},{"id":"S17-1027","title":"Classifying Semantic Clause Types: Modeling Context and Genre Characteristics with Recurrent Neural Networks and Attention","authors":["Becker, Maria","Staniek, Michael","Nastase, Vivi","Palmer, Alexis","Frank, Anette"],"emails":["mbecker@cl.uni-heidelberg.de","staniek@cl.uni-heidelberg.de","nastase@cl.uni-heidelberg.de","alexis.palmer@unt.edu","frank@cl.uni-heidelberg.de"],"author_id":["maria-becker","michael-staniek","vivi-nastase","alexis-palmer","anette-frank"],"abstract":"Detecting aspectual properties of clauses in the form of situation entity types has been shown to depend on a combination of syntactic-semantic and contextual features.

Apart from implicitly capturing task relevant features, the advantage of our neural model is that it avoids the need to reproduce linguistic features for other languages and is thus more easily transferable.

It has been a puzzle in part due to difficulty in identifying its basic, fundamental components. Several studies have shown that some manifestations of schizophrenia (e.g., the negative symptoms that include blunting of speech prosody, as well as the disorganization symptoms that lead to disordered language) can be understood from the perspective of linguistics. However, schizophrenia research has not kept pace with technologies in computational linguistics, especially in semantics and pragmatics. As such, we examine the writings of schizophrenia patients analyzing their syntax, semantics and pragmatics. In addition, we analyze tweets of (self proclaimed) schizophrenia patients who publicly discuss their diagnoses. For writing samples dataset, syntactic features are found to be the most successful in classification whereas for the less structured Twitter dataset, a combination of features performed the best.","pages":"241--250","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/S17-1028","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/S17-1028","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 6th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*{SEM} 2017)"},{"id":"S17-1029","title":"Learning to Solve Geometry Problems from Natural Language Demonstrations in Textbooks","authors":["Sachan, Mrinmaya","Xing, Eric"],"emails":["mrinmays@cs.cmu.edu","epxing@cs.cmu.edu"],"author_id":["mrinmaya-sachan","eric-xing"],"abstract":"Humans as well as animals are good at imitation.
