The consequences of such phenomena are manifold, ranging from lousy decision-making process to bullying and violence episodes. Therefore, fact-checking algorithms became a valuable asset. To this aim, an important step to detect fake-news is to have access to a credibility score for a given information source. However, most of the widely used Web indicators have either been shut-down to the public (e.g., Google PageRank) or are not free for use (Alexa Rank). Further existing databases are short-manually curated lists of online sources, which do not scale. Finally, most of the research on the topic is theoretical-based or explore confidential data in a restricted simulation environment. In this paper we explore current research, highlight the challenges and propose solutions to tackle the problem of classifying websites into a credibility scale. The proposed model automatically extracts source reputation cues and computes a credibility factor, providing valuable insights which can help in belittling dubious and confirming trustful unknown websites.

In this paper, we present an end-to-end multi-task learning with bi-direction attention (EMBA) model to classify the claim as {``}supports{''}, {``}refutes{''} or {``}not enough info{''} with respect to the pages retrieved and detect sentences as evidence at the same time. We conduct experiments on the FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) paper test dataset and shared task test dataset, a new public dataset for verification against textual sources. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable performance compared with the baseline system.","pages":"138--144","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5523","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5523","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Fact Extraction and {VER}ification ({FEVER})"},{"id":"W18-5524","title":"Team {GESIS} Cologne: An all in all sentence-based approach for {FEVER}","authors":["Otto, Wolfgang"],"emails":["wolfgang.otto@gesis.org"],"author_id":["wolfgang-otto"],"abstract":"In this system description of our pipeline to participate at the Fever Shared Task, we describe our sentence-based approach.

As the tasks of fact checking and finding evidence are dependent on each other, an ideal model would consider the veracity of the claim when finding evidence and also find only the evidence that supports\/refutes the position of the claim. We thus jointly model the second stage by using a pointer network with the claim and evidence sentence represented using the ESIM module. For stage 2, we first train both components using multi-task learning over a larger memory of extracted sentences, then tune parameters to first extract sentences and predict the relation from only the extracted sentences.","pages":"150--155","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5525","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5525","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Fact Extraction and {VER}ification ({FEVER})"},{"id":"W18-5526","title":"{QED}: A fact verification system for the {FEVER} shared task","authors":["Luken, Jackson","Jiang, Nanjiang","de Marneffe, Marie-Catherine"],"emails":["luken.25@osu.edu","jiang.1879@osu.edu","demarneffe.1@osu.edu"],"author_id":["jackson-luken","nanjiang-jiang","marie-catherine-de-marneffe"],"abstract":"This paper describes our system submission to the 2018 Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) shared task.

This reliance on lexicalization may complicate the adaptation of these tools between domains. For example, such a system trained in the news domain may learn that a sentence like {``}Palestinians recognize Texas as part of Mexico{''} tends to be unsupported, but this fact (and its corresponding lexicalized cues) have no value in, say, a scientific domain. To mitigate this dependence on lexicalized information, in this paper we propose a model that reads two sentences, from any given domain, to determine entailment without using lexicalized features. Instead our model relies on features that are either unlexicalized or are domain independent such as proportion of negated verbs, antonyms, or noun overlap. In its current implementation, this model does not perform well on the FEVER dataset, due to two reasons. First, for the information retrieval portion of the task we used the baseline system provided, since this was not the aim of our project. Second, this is work in progress and we still are in the process of identifying more features and gradually increasing the accuracy of our model. In the end, we hope to build a generic end-to-end classifier, which can be used in a domain outside the one in which it was trained, with no or minimal re-training.","pages":"166--171","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5528","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5528","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Fact Extraction and {VER}ification ({FEVER})"}]
