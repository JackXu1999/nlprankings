We introduce the following hierarchical word structures to dependency parsing in Japanese: morphological units (a short unit word, SUW) and syntactic units (a long unit word, LUW). An SUW can be used to segment a sentence consistently, while it is too short to represent syntactic construction. An LUW is a unit including functional multiwords and LUW-based analysis facilitates the capturing of syntactic structure and makes parsing results more precise than SUW-based analysis. This paper describes the results of a feasibility study on the ability and the effectiveness of parsing methods based on hierarchical word structure (LUW chunking+parsing) in comparison to single layer word structure (SUW parsing). We also show joint analysis of LUW-chunking and dependency parsing improves the performance of identifying predicate-argument structures, while there is not much difference between overall results of them. not much difference between overall results of them.","pages":"56--60","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-6308","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Pisa, Italy","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Parsing Technologies"},{"id":"W17-6309","title":"Leveraging Newswire Treebanks for Parsing Conversational Data with Argument Scrambling","authors":["Bhat, Riyaz A.","Bhat, Irshad","Sharma, Dipti"],"emails":["riyaz.bhat@colorado.edu","irshad.bhat@research.iiit.ac.in","dipti@iiit.ac.in"],"author_id":["riyaz-ahmad-bhat","irshad-bhat","dipti-misra-sharma"],"abstract":"We investigate the problem of parsing conversational data of morphologically-rich languages such as Hindi where argument scrambling occurs frequently.
