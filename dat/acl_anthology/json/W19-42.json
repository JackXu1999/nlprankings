Specifically, we use a parallel Bible corpus to align contextual embeddings at the verse level. The aligned verses are used to build cross-language translation matrices, which in turn are used to map between embedding spaces for the various languages. Finally, we use sets of inflected forms, primarily from a high-resource language, to induce vector representations for individual UniMorph tags.

The key difference is that our model transforms the whole word form in every step, instead of consuming it character by character. We propose a merging strategy inspired by Byte-Pair-Encoding that reduces the space of valid operations by merging frequent adjacent operations. The resulting operations not only encode the actions to be performed but the relative position in the word token and how characters need to be transformed.

However, the implicit assumption that present tense forms are bases for verbal inflection should not be blindly extended to morphologically rich languages like Japanese in which both present and past tense forms are morphologically complex without inherent direction (Albright, 2002). Interestingly, there are also independent observations in the acquisition literature to suggest that past tense forms may be bases for verbal inflection in Japanese (Klafehn, 2003; Murasugi et al., 2010; Hirose, 2017; Tatsumi et al., 2018). In this paper, we computationally simulate two directions of verbal inflection in Japanese, Present \u2192 Past and Past \u2192 Present, with the rule-based computational model called Minimal Generalization Learner (MGL; Albright and Hayes, 2003) and experimentally evaluate the model with the bidirectional {``}wug{''} test where humans inflect novel verbs in two opposite directions.

In addition, many of these polysynthetic languages are low-resource. We propose unsupervised approaches for morphological segmentation of low-resource polysynthetic languages based on Adaptor Grammars (AG) (Eskander et al., 2016). We experiment with four languages from the Uto-Aztecan family. Our AG-based approaches outperform other unsupervised approaches and show promise when compared to supervised methods, outperforming them on two of the four languages.","pages":"189--195","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-4222","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-4222","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 16th Workshop on Computational Research in Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology"},{"id":"W19-4223","title":"Weakly deterministic transformations are subregular","authors":["Lamont, Andrew","O{'}Hara, Charlie","Smith, Caitlin"],"emails":["alamont@linguist.umass.edu","charleso@usc.edu","csmit372@jhu.edu"],"author_id":["andrew-lamont","charlie-ohara","caitlin-smith"],"abstract":"Whether phonological transformations in general are subregular is an open question.

All submissions featured a neural component and built on either this year{'}s strong baselines or highly ranked systems from previous years{'} shared tasks.
