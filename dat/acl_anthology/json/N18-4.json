This process is helped along through linguistic alignment: participants{'} adoption of each other{'}s word use. This alignment is robust, appearing many settings, and is nearly always positive. We create an alignment model for examining alignment in Twitter conversations across antagonistic groups. This model finds that some word categories, specifically pronouns used to establish group identity and common ground, are negatively aligned. This negative alignment is observed despite other categories, which are less related to the group dynamics, showing the standard positive alignment. This suggests that alignment is strongly biased toward cooperative alignment, but that different linguistic features can show substantially different behaviors.","pages":"1--8","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N18-4001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N18-4001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Student Research Workshop"},{"id":"N18-4002","title":"Combining Abstractness and Language-specific Theoretical Indicators for Detecting Non-Literal Usage of {E}stonian Particle Verbs","authors":["Aedmaa, Eleri","K{\\\"o}per, Maximilian","Schulte im Walde, Sabine"],"emails":["eleri.aedmaa@ut.ee","maximilian.koeper@ims.uni-stuttgart.de","schulte@ims.uni-stuttgart.de"],"author_id":["eleri-aedmaa","maximilian-koper","sabine-schulte-im-walde"],"abstract":"This paper presents two novel datasets and a random-forest classifier to automatically predict literal vs. non-literal language usage for a highly frequent type of multi-word expression in a low-resource language, i.e., Estonian.

We apply self-attention to link the cloze token with other tokens in a query so that the importance of query tokens with respect to the cloze position are weighted.

Existing work on such models has shown that, while they perform well on tasks like sentence classification, they do not learn grammars that conform to any plausible semantic or syntactic formalism (Williams et al., 2018a). Studying the parsing ability of such models in natural language can be challenging due to the inherent complexities of natural language, like having several valid parses for a single sentence. In this paper we introduce ListOps, a toy dataset created to study the parsing ability of latent tree models. ListOps sequences are in the style of prefix arithmetic. The dataset is designed to have a single correct parsing strategy that a system needs to learn to succeed at the task. We show that the current leading latent tree models are unable to learn to parse and succeed at ListOps.
