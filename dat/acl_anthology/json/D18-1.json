We study a specific type of attack: an attacker eavesdrops on the hidden representations of a neural text classifier and tries to recover information about the input text. Such scenario may arise in situations when the computation of a neural network is shared across multiple devices, e.g. some hidden representation is computed by a user{'}s device and sent to a cloud-based model. We measure the privacy of a hidden representation by the ability of an attacker to predict accurately specific private information from it and characterize the tradeoff between the privacy and the utility of neural representations. Finally, we propose several defense methods based on modified training objectives and show that they improve the privacy of neural representations.","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1002","title":"Adversarial Removal of Demographic Attributes from Text Data","authors":["Elazar, Yanai","Goldberg, Yoav"],"emails":["yanaiela@gmail.com","yoav.goldberg@gmail.com"],"author_id":["yanai-elazar","yoav-goldberg"],"abstract":"Recent advances in Representation Learning and Adversarial Training seem to succeed in removing unwanted features from the learned representation.

However, given a large collection of text, finding evidence that could support or refute a given claim is a challenge in itself, amplified by the fact that different evidence might be needed to support or refute a claim. Nevertheless, most prior work decouples evidence finding from determining the truth value of the claim given the evidence. We propose to consider these two aspects jointly. We develop TwoWingOS (two-wing optimization strategy), a system that, while identifying appropriate evidence for a claim, also determines whether or not the claim is supported by the evidence. Given the claim, TwoWingOS attempts to identify a subset of the evidence candidates; given the predicted evidence, it then attempts to determine the truth value of the corresponding claim entailment problem. We treat this problem as coupled optimization problems, training a joint model for it. TwoWingOS offers two advantages: (i) Unlike pipeline systems it facilitates flexible-size evidence set, and (ii) Joint training improves both the claim entailment and the evidence identification.

With globalization, the need for providing cross-lingual customer support becomes more urgent than ever. However, cross-lingual support poses great challenges{---}it requires a large amount of additional annotated data from native speakers. In order to bypass the expensive human annotation and achieve the first step towards the ultimate goal of building a universal dialog system, we set out to build a cross-lingual state tracking framework. Specifically, we assume that there exists a source language with dialog belief tracking annotations while the target languages have no annotated dialog data of any form. Then, we pre-train a state tracker for the source language as a teacher, which is able to exploit easy-to-access parallel data.

Intuitively, words in a sentence are related to its domain to varying degrees, so that they will exert disparate impacts on the multi-domain NMT modeling. Based on this intuition, in this paper, we devote to distinguishing and exploiting word-level domain contexts for multi-domain NMT. To this end, we jointly model NMT with monolingual attention-based domain classification tasks and improve NMT as follows: 1) Based on the sentence representations produced by a domain classifier and an adversarial domain classifier, we generate two gating vectors and use them to construct domain-specific and domain-shared annotations, for later translation predictions via different attention models; 2) We utilize the attention weights derived from target-side domain classifier to adjust the weights of target words in the training objective, enabling domain-related words to have greater impacts during model training.

The increasingly popular neural network techniques have been proven effective for semantic encoding, whereby widely employed to boost semantic relation discrimination.

In this paper, we follow Rutherford and Xue (2015) to expand the training data set using the corpus of explicitly-related arguments, by arbitrarily dropping the overtly presented discourse connectives. On the basis, we carry out an experiment of sampling, in which a simple active learning approach is used, so as to take the informative instances for data expansion.

In this paper, we propose Sequence to Sequence with Prototype Memory Network (S2SPMN) to exploit the relevant information provided by the large dialogue corpus to enhance response generation.

These approaches typically train a sequence-to-sequence learning model using a syntax-based objective: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Such syntax-based approaches do not effectively address the goal of generating semantically correct programs, because these approaches fail to handle Program Aliasing, i.e., semantically equivalent programs may have many syntactically different forms. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a semantics-based approach named SemRegex. SemRegex provides solutions for a subtask of the program-synthesis problem: generating regular expressions from natural language. Different from the existing syntax-based approaches, SemRegex trains the model by maximizing the expected semantic correctness of the generated regular expressions. The semantic correctness is measured using the DFA-equivalence oracle, random test cases, and distinguishing test cases. The experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of SemRegex over the existing state-of-the-art approaches.","pages":"1608--1618","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1189","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1189","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1190","title":"Decoupling Structure and Lexicon for Zero-Shot Semantic Parsing","authors":["Herzig, Jonathan","Berant, Jonathan"],"emails":["jonathan.herzig@cs.tau.ac.il","joberant@cs.tau.ac.il"],"author_id":["jonathan-herzig","jonathan-berant"],"abstract":"Building a semantic parser quickly in a new domain is a fundamental challenge for conversational interfaces, as current semantic parsers require expensive supervision and lack the ability to generalize to new domains.

First, we decompose the decoder into a contextual network that retrieves relevant parts of the source document, and a pretrained language model that incorporates prior knowledge about language generation. Second, we propose a novelty metric that is optimized directly through policy learning to encourage the generation of novel phrases. Our model achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as determined by ROUGE scores and human evaluations, while achieving a significantly higher level of abstraction as measured by n-gram overlap with the source document.","pages":"1808--1817","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1207","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1207","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1208","title":"Content Selection in Deep Learning Models of Summarization","authors":["Kedzie, Chris","McKeown, Kathleen","Daum{\\'e} III, Hal"],"emails":["kedzie@cs.columbia.edu","kathy@cs.columbia.edu","hal@cs.umd.edu"],"author_id":["chris-kedzie","kathleen-mckeown","hal-daume-iii"],"abstract":"We carry out experiments with deep learning models of summarization across the domains of news, personal stories, meetings, and medical articles in order to understand how content selection is performed.

But its applicability is limited by the reliance on annotated examples, which are difficult to produce at scale. Indirect supervision has emerged as a promising direction to address this bottleneck, either by introducing labeling functions to automatically generate noisy examples from unlabeled text, or by imposing constraints over interdependent label decisions. A plethora of methods have been proposed, each with respective strengths and limitations. Probabilistic logic offers a unifying language to represent indirect supervision, but end-to-end modeling with probabilistic logic is often infeasible due to intractable inference and learning. In this paper, we propose deep probabilistic logic (DPL) as a general framework for indirect supervision, by composing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL models label decisions as latent variables, represents prior knowledge on their relations using weighted first-order logical formulas, and alternates between learning a deep neural network for the end task and refining uncertain formula weights for indirect supervision, using variational EM. This framework subsumes prior indirect supervision methods as special cases, and enables novel combination via infusion of rich domain and linguistic knowledge. Experiments on biomedical machine reading demonstrate the promise of this approach.","pages":"1891--1902","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1215","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1215","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1216","title":"Deriving Machine Attention from Human Rationales","authors":["Bao, Yujia","Chang, Shiyu","Yu, Mo","Barzilay, Regina"],"emails":["yum@us.ibm.com","shiyu.chang@ibm.com","yujia@csail.mit.edu","regina@csail.mit.edu"],"author_id":["yujia-bao","shiyu-chang","mo-yu","regina-barzilay"],"abstract":"Attention-based models are successful when trained on large amounts of data.

It is reasonable to claim that it is impossible to create a RE that is capable of identifying such entities from web documents with perfect precision and recall. Rather than abandoning REs as a go-to approach for entity detection, this paper explores ways to combine the expressive power of REs, ability of deep learning to learn from large data, and human-in-the loop approach into a new integrated framework for entity identification from web data. The framework starts by creating or collecting the existing REs for a particular type of an entity. Those REs are then used over a large document corpus to collect weak labels for the entity mentions and a neural network is trained to predict those RE-generated weak labels. Finally, a human expert is asked to label a small set of documents and the neural network is fine tuned on those documents.

Learned composition modules recursively combine constituent spans, culminating in a grounding for the complete sentence which answers the question.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel multi-level structured (2-D matrix) self-attention mechanism for DS-RE in a multi-instance learning (MIL) framework using bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BiRNN). In the proposed method, a structured word-level self-attention learns a 2-D matrix where each row vector represents a weight distribution for different aspects of an instance regarding two entities.

Experiments conducted on two publicly available DS-RE datasets show that the proposed framework with multi-level structured self-attention mechanism significantly outperform baselines in terms of PR curves, P@N and F1 measures.","pages":"2216--2225","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1245","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1245","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1246","title":"N-ary Relation Extraction using Graph-State {LSTM}","authors":["Song, Linfeng","Zhang, Yue","Wang, Zhiguo","Gildea, Daniel"],"emails":["","","",""],"author_id":["linfeng-song","yue-zhang","zhiguo-wang","daniel-gildea"],"abstract":"Cross-sentence $n$-ary relation extraction detects relations among $n$ entities across multiple sentences.

We propose a graph-state LSTM model, which uses a parallel state to model each word, recurrently enriching state values via message passing.

However, when the pair of entities has multiple relationships in the KG, this assumption may produce noisy relation labels. This paper proposes a label-free distant supervision method, which makes no use of the relation labels under this inadequate assumption, but only uses the prior knowledge derived from the KG to supervise the learning of the classifier directly and softly. Specifically, we make use of the type information and the translation law derived from typical KG embedding model to learn embeddings for certain sentence patterns. As the supervision signal is only determined by the two aligned entities, neither hard relation labels nor extra noise-reduction model for the bag of sentences is needed in this way.

For example, it is common for humans to (involuntarily) produce utterances which are copied or suitably modified from background articles they have read about the topic. To facilitate the development of such natural conversation models which mimic the human process of conversing, we create a new dataset containing movie chats wherein each response is explicitly generated by copying and\/or modifying sentences from unstructured background knowledge such as plots, comments and reviews about the movie. We establish baseline results on this dataset (90K utterances from 9K conversations) using three different models: (i) pure generation based models which ignore the background knowledge (ii) generation based models which learn to copy information from the background knowledge when required and (iii) span prediction based models which predict the appropriate response span in the background knowledge.","pages":"2322--2332","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1255","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1255","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1256","title":"Decoupling Strategy and Generation in Negotiation Dialogues","authors":["He, He","Chen, Derek","Balakrishnan, Anusha","Liang, Percy"],"emails":["hehe@cs.stanford.edu","derekchen14@cs.stanford.edu","anusha@cs.stanford.edu","pliang@cs.stanford.edu"],"author_id":["he-he","derek-chen","anusha-balakrishnan","percy-liang"],"abstract":"We consider negotiation settings in which two agents use natural language to bargain on goods.

Hence, to help POS tagging for Twitter, most domain adaptation methods try to leverage newswire datasets by learning the shared features between the two domains. However, from a linguistic perspective, Twitter users not only tend to mimic the formal expressions of traditional media, like news, but they also appear to be developing linguistically informal styles.

A human subject study further shows that the commonsense evidence gathered by CVAE can be communicated to humans to achieve a significantly higher common ground between humans and agents.","pages":"2627--2637","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1283","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1283","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1284","title":"Learning Personas from Dialogue with Attentive Memory Networks","authors":["Chu, Eric","Vijayaraghavan, Prashanth","Roy, Deb"],"emails":["echu@mit.edu","pralav@mit.edu","dkroy@media.mit.edu"],"author_id":["eric-chu","prashanth-vijayaraghavan","deb-roy"],"abstract":"The ability to infer persona from dialogue can have applications in areas ranging from computational narrative analysis to personalized dialogue generation.

The present work instead applies depth bounds within a chart-based Bayesian PCFG inducer, where bounding can be switched on and off, and then samples trees with or without bounding. Results show that depth-bounding is indeed significantly effective in limiting the search space of the inducer and thereby increasing accuracy of resulting parsing model, independent of the contribution of modern Bayesian induction techniques.

The problem of computing infix probabilities of strings when the pattern distribution is given by a probabilistic context-free grammar or by a probabilistic finite automaton is already solved, yet it was open to compute the infix probabilities in an incremental manner. The incremental computation is crucial when a new query is built from a previous query. We tackle this problem and suggest a method that computes infix probabilities incrementally for probabilistic finite automata by representing all the probabilities of matching strings as a series of transition matrix calculations.

In this work, we introduce three strategies to improve one-to-many multilingual translation by balancing the shared and unique features.

Experiments on Hindi-English part-of-speech tagging demonstrate that our approach outperforms standard models when training on monolingual text without transliteration, and testing on code-switched text with alternate scripts.","pages":"3084--3089","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1347","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1347","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1348","title":"Zero-shot User Intent Detection via Capsule Neural Networks","authors":["Xia, Congying","Zhang, Chenwei","Yan, Xiaohui","Chang, Yi","Yu, Philip"],"emails":["cxia8@uic.edu","czhang99@uic.edu","yanxiaohui2@huawei.com","yichang@acm.org","psyu@uic.edu"],"author_id":["congying-xia","chenwei-zhang","xiaohui-yan","yi-chang","philip-s-yu"],"abstract":"User intent detection plays a critical role in question-answering and dialog systems.

Nevertheless, those models simply embed entities and relations into latent vectors without leveraging the rich information from the relation structure. Indeed, relations in KGs conform to a three-layer hierarchical relation structure (HRS), i.e., semantically similar relations can make up relation clusters and some relations can be further split into several fine-grained sub-relations. Relation clusters, relations and sub-relations can fit in the top, the middle and the bottom layer of three-layer HRS respectively.

In this paper, we propose multimodal knowledge base embeddings (MKBE) that use different neural encoders for this variety of observed data, and combine them with existing relational models to learn embeddings of the entities and multimodal data. Further, using these learned embedings and different neural decoders, we introduce a novel multimodal imputation model to generate missing multimodal values, like text and images, from information in the knowledge base.

In a Q20 game system, the user is considered as the answerer while the system itself acts as the questioner which requires a good strategy of question selection to figure out the correct object and win the game. However, the optimal policy of question selection is hard to be derived due to the complexity and volatility of the game environment. In this paper, we propose a novel policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) method, which enables the questioner agent to learn the optimal policy of question selection through continuous interactions with users.

Unlike the state-of-the-art approach, which treats an action as a sequence, our model uses an attention mechanism to integrate information from a set of comments. Thus, the prediction of Q-value is invariant to the permutation of the comments, which leads to a more consistent agent behavior. Second, we employ a greedy procedure to approximate the action that maximizes the predicted Q-value from a combinatorial action space.

Conditional models are frequently encountered in practice; however there has not been a rigorous theoretical analysis of NCE in this setting, and we will argue there are subtle but important questions when generalizing NCE to the conditional case. In particular, we analyze two variants of NCE for conditional models: one based on a classification objective, the other based on a ranking objective.

However, besides exposure bias, models trained with MLE suffer from wrong objective problem where they are trained to maximize the word-level correct next step prediction, but are evaluated with respect to sequence-level discrete metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU. Several variants of policy-gradient methods address some of these problems by optimizing for final discrete evaluation metrics and showing improvements over MLE training for downstream tasks like text summarization and machine translation. However, policy-gradient methods suffers from high sample variance, making the training process very difficult and unstable. In this paper, we present an alternative direction towards mitigating this problem by introducing a new objective (CaLcs) based on a differentiable surrogate of longest common subsequence (LCS) measure that captures sequence-level structure similarity. Experimental results on abstractive summarization and machine translation validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","pages":"3708--3718","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1406","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1406","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1407","title":"Pathologies of Neural Models Make Interpretations Difficult","authors":["Feng, Shi","Wallace, Eric","Grissom II, Alvin","Iyyer, Mohit","Rodriguez, Pedro","Boyd-Graber, Jordan"],"emails":["shifeng@umiacs.umd.edu","ewallac2@umiacs.umd.edu","agrissom@ursinus.edu","miyyer@cs.umass.edu","entilzha@umiacs.umd.edu","jbg@umiacs.umd.edu"],"author_id":["shi-feng","eric-wallace","alvin-grissom-ii","mohit-iyyer","pedro-rodriguez","jordan-boyd-graber"],"abstract":"One way to interpret neural model predictions is to highlight the most important input features{---}for example, a heatmap visualization over the words in an input sentence.

To understand the limitations of these methods, we use input reduction, which iteratively removes the least important word from the input. This exposes pathological behaviors of neural models: the remaining words appear nonsensical to humans and are not the ones determined as important by interpretation methods. As we confirm with human experiments, the reduced examples lack information to support the prediction of any label, but models still make the same predictions with high confidence. To explain these counterintuitive results, we draw connections to adversarial examples and confidence calibration: pathological behaviors reveal difficulties in interpreting neural models trained with maximum likelihood. To mitigate their deficiencies, we fine-tune the models by encouraging high entropy outputs on reduced examples. Fine-tuned models become more interpretable under input reduction, without accuracy loss on regular examples.","pages":"3719--3728","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1407","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1407","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1408","title":"Phrase-level Self-Attention Networks for Universal Sentence Encoding","authors":["Wu, Wei","Wang, Houfeng","Liu, Tianyu","Ma, Shuming"],"emails":["wu.wei@pku.edu.cn","wanghf@pku.edu.cn","tianyu0421@pku.edu.cn","shumingma@pku.edu.cn"],"author_id":["wei-wu","houfeng-wang","tianyu-liu","shuming-ma"],"abstract":"Universal sentence encoding is a hot topic in recent NLP research. Attention mechanism has been an integral part in many sentence encoding models, allowing the models to capture context dependencies regardless of the distance between the elements in the sequence. Fully attention-based models have recently attracted enormous interest due to their highly parallelizable computation and significantly less training time. However, the memory consumption of their models grows quadratically with the sentence length, and the syntactic information is neglected. To this end, we propose Phrase-level Self-Attention Networks (PSAN) that perform self-attention across words inside a phrase to capture context dependencies at the phrase level, and use the gated memory updating mechanism to refine each word{'}s representation hierarchically with longer-term context dependencies captured in a larger phrase. As a result, the memory consumption can be reduced because the self-attention is performed at the phrase level instead of the sentence level. At the same time, syntactic information can be easily integrated in the model. Experiment results show that PSAN can achieve the state-of-the-art performance across a plethora of NLP tasks including binary and multi-class classification, natural language inference and sentence similarity.","pages":"3729--3738","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1408","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1408","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1409","title":"{B}andit{S}um: Extractive Summarization as a Contextual Bandit","authors":["Dong, Yue","Shen, Yikang","Crawford, Eric","van Hoof, Herke","Cheung, Jackie Chi Kit"],"emails":["yue.dong2@mail.mcgill.ca","yi-kang.shen@umontreal.ca","eric.crawford@mail.mcgill.ca","h.c.vanhoof@uva.nl","jcheung@cs.mcgill.ca"],"author_id":["yue-dong","yikang-shen","eric-crawford","herke-van-hoof","jackie-chi-kit-cheung"],"abstract":"In this work, we propose a novel method for training neural networks to perform single-document extractive summarization without heuristically-generated extractive labels.

To capture this type of information, we propose an autoencoder model with a latent space defined by a hierarchy of categorical variables. We utilize a recently proposed vector quantization based approach, which allows continuous embeddings to be associated with each latent variable value. This permits the decoder to softly decide what portions of the latent hierarchy to condition on by attending over the value embeddings for a given setting.

Furthermore, the content selector can be trained with as little as 1,000 sentences making it easy to transfer a trained summarizer to a new domain.","pages":"4098--4109","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1443","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1443","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1444","title":"Controlling Length in Abstractive Summarization Using a Convolutional Neural Network","authors":["Liu, Yizhu","Luo, Zhiyi","Zhu, Kenny"],"emails":["1liuyizhu@sjtu.edu.cn","2jessherlock@sjtu.edu.cn","3kzhu@cs.sjtu.edu.cn"],"author_id":["yizhu-liu","zhiyi-luo","kenny-zhu"],"abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have met great success in abstractive summarization, but they cannot effectively generate summaries of desired lengths.

There is a pressing need to adapt an encoder-decoder model trained on single-document summarization data to work with multiple-document input. In this paper, we present an initial investigation into a novel adaptation method. It exploits the maximal marginal relevance method to select representative sentences from multi-document input, and leverages an abstractive encoder-decoder model to fuse disparate sentences to an abstractive summary.

In this paper, we show that the modeling problem can be solved by standard sequence-to-sequence architectures of sufficient depth, and that deep models operating at the character level outperform identical models operating over word fragments. This result implies that alternative architectures for handling character input are better viewed as methods for reducing computation time than as improved ways of modeling longer sequences. From this perspective, we evaluate several techniques for character-level NMT, verify that they do not match the performance of our deep character baseline model, and evaluate the performance versus computation time tradeoffs they offer.

To sidestep the non-differentiability of discrete natural language tokens, we introduce an auxiliary continuous code space and map such code space to a learnable prior distribution for generation purpose. Experiments on two dialogue datasets validate the effectiveness of our model, where the generated responses are closely related to the dialogue context and lead to more interactive conversations.","pages":"4316--4327","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1463","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1463","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1464","title":"A Neural Local Coherence Model for Text Quality Assessment","authors":["Mesgar, Mohsen","Strube, Michael"],"emails":["","michael.strube@h-its.org"],"author_id":["mohsen-mesgar","michael-strube"],"abstract":"We propose a local coherence model that captures the flow of what semantically connects adjacent sentences in a text.

CSRAN incorporates two novel components to take advantage of the stacked architecture. Firstly, it introduces a new bidirectional alignment mechanism that learns affinity weights by fusing sequence pairs across stacked hierarchies. Secondly, it leverages a multi-level attention refinement component between stacked recurrent layers.

In this work, we experiment with another choice of latent distribution, namely the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, which places mass on the surface of the unit hypersphere. With this choice of prior and posterior, the KL divergence term now only depends on the variance of the vMF distribution, giving us the ability to treat it as a fixed hyperparameter. We show that doing so not only averts the KL collapse, but consistently gives better likelihoods than Gaussians across a range of modeling conditions, including recurrent language modeling and bag-of-words document modeling. An analysis of the properties of our vMF representations shows that they learn richer and more nuanced structures in their latent representations than their Gaussian counterparts.","pages":"4503--4513","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1480","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1480","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1481","title":"Learning Universal Sentence Representations with Mean-Max Attention Autoencoder","authors":["Zhang, Minghua","Wu, Yunfang","Li, Weikang","Li, Wei"],"emails":["zhangmh@pku.edu.cn","wuyf@pku.edu.cn","liweitj47@pku.edu.cn","wavejkd@pku.edu.cn"],"author_id":["minghua-zhang","yunfang-wu","weigang-li","wei-li"],"abstract":"In order to learn universal sentence representations, previous methods focus on complex recurrent neural networks or supervised learning.

In our formulation, the monolingual clusters group together documents while the crosslingual clusters group together monolingual clusters, one per language that appears in the stream. Our method is simple to implement, computationally efficient and produces state-of-the-art results on datasets in German, English and Spanish.","pages":"4535--4544","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1483","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1483","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1484","title":"Multi-Task Label Embedding for Text Classification","authors":["Zhang, Honglun","Xiao, Liqiang","Chen, Wenqing","Wang, Yongkun","Jin, Yaohui"],"emails":["","","","","jinyh@sjtu.edu.cn"],"author_id":["honglun-zhang","liqiang-xiao","wenqing-chen","yongkun-wang","yaohui-jin"],"abstract":"Multi-task learning in text classification leverages implicit correlations among related tasks to extract common features and yield performance gains.

The Biterm Topic Model (BTM) learns topics by modeling the word-pairs named biterms in the whole corpus. This assumption is very strong when documents are long with rich topic information and do not exhibit the transitivity of biterms. In this paper, we propose a novel way called GraphBTM to represent biterms as graphs and design a Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with residual connections to extract transitive features from biterms. To overcome the data sparsity of LDA and the strong assumption of BTM, we sample a fixed number of documents to form a mini-corpus as a sample.

Experimental results on two datasets show that our joint learning model can outperform other baselines and demonstrate the effectiveness of HSBi-GRU in learning abstract features.","pages":"4737--4742","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1504","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1504","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1505","title":"Revisiting the Importance of Encoding Logic Rules in Sentiment Classification","authors":["Krishna, Kalpesh","Jyothi, Preethi","Iyyer, Mohit"],"emails":["kalpesh@cs.umass.edu","pjyothi@cse.iitb.ac.in","miyyer@cs.umass.edu"],"author_id":["kalpesh-krishna","preethi-jyothi","mohit-iyyer"],"abstract":"We analyze the performance of different sentiment classification models on syntactically complex inputs like A-but-B sentences.

Our findings show considerable improvements for all tasks, particularly in the learning what to share setting which shows consistent gains across all tasks.","pages":"4881--4889","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1526","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1526","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1527","title":"Conditional Word Embedding and Hypothesis Testing via {B}ayes-by-Backprop","authors":["Han, Rujun","Gill, Michael","Spirling, Arthur","Cho, Kyunghyun"],"emails":["rujunhan@usc.edu","mzgill@nyu.edu","arthur.spirling@nyu.edu","kyunghyun.cho@nyu.edu"],"author_id":["rujun-han","michael-gill","arthur-spirling","kyunghyun-cho"],"abstract":"Conventional word embedding models do not leverage information from document meta-data, and they do not model uncertainty.

By comparison, SQuAD and CNN appear better-constructed.","pages":"5010--5015","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1546","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1546","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1547","title":"{M}ulti{WOZ} - A Large-Scale Multi-Domain Wizard-of-{O}z Dataset for Task-Oriented Dialogue Modelling","authors":["Budzianowski, Pawe{\\l}","Wen, Tsung-Hsien","Tseng, Bo-Hsiang","Casanueva, I{\\~n}igo","Ultes, Stefan","Ramadan, Osman","Ga{\\v{s}}i{\\'c}, Milica"],"emails":["pfb30@cam.ac.uk","","","","","","mg436@cam.ac.uk"],"author_id":["pawel-budzianowski","tsung-hsien-wen","bo-hsiang-tseng","inigo-casanueva","stefan-ultes","osman-ramadan","milica-gasic"],"abstract":"Even though machine learning has become the major scene in dialogue research community, the real breakthrough has been blocked by the scale of data available.To address this fundamental obstacle, we introduce the Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset (MultiWOZ), a fully-labeled collection of human-human written conversations spanning over multiple domains and topics.At a size of 10k dialogues, it is at least one order of magnitude larger than all previous annotated task-oriented corpora.The contribution of this work apart from the open-sourced dataset is two-fold:firstly, a detailed description of the data collection procedure along with a summary of data structure and analysis is provided. The proposed data-collection pipeline is entirely based on crowd-sourcing without the need of hiring professional annotators;secondly, a set of benchmark results of belief tracking, dialogue act and response generation is reported, which shows the usability of the data and sets a baseline for future studies.","pages":"5016--5026","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1547","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1547","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1548","title":"Linguistically-Informed Self-Attention for Semantic Role Labeling","authors":["Strubell, Emma","Verga, Patrick","Andor, Daniel","Weiss, David","McCallum, Andrew"],"emails":["strubell@cs.umass.edu","pat@cs.umass.edu","andor@google.com","djweiss@google.com","mccallum@cs.umass.edu"],"author_id":["emma-strubell","patrick-verga","daniel-andor","david-weiss","andrew-mccallum"],"abstract":"Current state-of-the-art semantic role labeling (SRL) uses a deep neural network with no explicit linguistic features. However, prior work has shown that gold syntax trees can dramatically improve SRL decoding, suggesting the possibility of increased accuracy from explicit modeling of syntax. In this work, we present linguistically-informed self-attention (LISA): a neural network model that combines multi-head self-attention with multi-task learning across dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, predicate detection and SRL. Unlike previous models which require significant pre-processing to prepare linguistic features, LISA can incorporate syntax using merely raw tokens as input, encoding the sequence only once to simultaneously perform parsing, predicate detection and role labeling for all predicates. Syntax is incorporated by training one attention head to attend to syntactic parents for each token. Moreover, if a high-quality syntactic parse is already available, it can be beneficially injected at test time without re-training our SRL model. In experiments on CoNLL-2005 SRL, LISA achieves new state-of-the-art performance for a model using predicted predicates and standard word embeddings, attaining 2.5 F1 absolute higher than the previous state-of-the-art on newswire and more than 3.5 F1 on out-of-domain data, nearly 10{\\%} reduction in error. On ConLL-2012 English SRL we also show an improvement of more than 2.5 F1. LISA also out-performs the state-of-the-art with contextually-encoded (ELMo) word representations, by nearly 1.0 F1 on news and more than 2.0 F1 on out-of-domain text.","pages":"5027--5038","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1548","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1548","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"D18-1549","title":"Phrase-Based {\\&} Neural Unsupervised Machine Translation","authors":["Lample, Guillaume","Ott, Myle","Conneau, Alexis","Denoyer, Ludovic","Ranzato, Marc{'}Aurelio"],"emails":["glample@fb.com","myleott@fb.com","aconneau@fb.com","ludovic.denoyer@lip6.fr","ranzato@fb.com"],"author_id":["guillaume-lample","myle-ott","alexis-conneau","ludovic-denoyer","marcaurelio-ranzato"],"abstract":"Machine translation systems achieve near human-level performance on some languages, yet their effectiveness strongly relies on the availability of large amounts of parallel sentences, which hinders their applicability to the majority of language pairs. This work investigates how to learn to translate when having access to only large monolingual corpora in each language. We propose two model variants, a neural and a phrase-based model. Both versions leverage a careful initialization of the parameters, the denoising effect of language models and automatic generation of parallel data by iterative back-translation. These models are significantly better than methods from the literature, while being simpler and having fewer hyper-parameters. On the widely used WMT{'}14 English-French and WMT{'}16 German-English benchmarks, our models respectively obtain 28.1 and 25.2 BLEU points without using a single parallel sentence, outperforming the state of the art by more than 11 BLEU points. On low-resource languages like English-Urdu and English-Romanian, our methods achieve even better results than semi-supervised and supervised approaches leveraging the paucity of available bitexts. Our code for NMT and PBSMT is publicly available.","pages":"5039--5049","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-1549","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-1549","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October-November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"}]
