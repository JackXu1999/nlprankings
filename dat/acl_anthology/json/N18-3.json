As a first step towards reimbursement healthcare institutions need to associate ICD-10 billing codes to these documents. This is done by trained clinical coders who may use a computer assisted solution for shortlisting of codes. In this work, we present our work to build a machine learning based scalable system for predicting ICD-10 codes from electronic medical records. We address data imbalance issues by implementing two system architectures using convolutional neural networks and logistic regression models. We illustrate the pros and cons of those system designs and show that the best performance can be achieved by leveraging the advantages of both using a system combination approach.","pages":"1--7","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N18-3001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N18-3001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans - Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 3 (Industry Papers)"},{"id":"N18-3002","title":"Neural Network based Extreme Classification and Similarity Models for Product Matching","authors":["Shah, Kashif","Kopru, Selcuk","Ruvini, Jean-David"],"emails":["skshah@ebay.com","skopru@ebay.com","jean-david.ruvini@ebay.com"],"author_id":["kashif-shah","selcuk-kopru","jean-david-ruvini"],"abstract":"Matching a seller listed item to an appropriate product has become a fundamental and one of the most significant step for e-commerce platforms for product based experience.

Further, the Wizard-of-Oz approach commonly used for dialogue collection does not provide sufficient coverage of salient dialogue flows, which is critical for guaranteeing an acceptable task completion rate in consumer-facing conversational agents.

Performance of the title generation system is evaluated on three different languages; English, German, and French, with a particular focus on low-resourced French language.","pages":"162--169","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N18-3020","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N18-3020","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans - Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 3 (Industry Papers)"},{"id":"N18-3021","title":"A Novel Approach to Part Name Discovery in Noisy Text","authors":["Niraula, Nobal Bikram","Whyatt, Daniel","Kao, Anne"],"emails":["nobal.b.niraula@boeing.com","daniel.whyatt@boeing.com","anne.kao@boeing.com"],"author_id":["nobal-bikram-niraula","daniel-whyatt","anne-kao"],"abstract":"As a specialized example of information extraction, part name extraction is an area that presents unique challenges. Part names are typically multi-word terms longer than two words. There is little consistency in how terms are described in noisy free text, with variations spawned by typos, ad hoc abbreviations, acronyms, and incomplete names. This makes search and analyses of parts in these data extremely challenging. In this paper, we present our algorithm, PANDA (Part Name Discovery Analytics), based on a unique method that exploits statistical, linguistic and machine learning techniques to discover part names in noisy text such as that in manufacturing quality documentation, supply chain management records, service communication logs, and maintenance reports. Experiments show that PANDA is scalable and outperforms existing techniques significantly.","pages":"170--176","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N18-3021","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N18-3021","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans - Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 3 (Industry Papers)"},{"id":"N18-3022","title":"The {A}lexa Meaning Representation Language","authors":["Kollar, Thomas","Berry, Danielle","Stuart, Lauren","Owczarzak, Karolina","Chung, Tagyoung","Mathias, Lambert","Kayser, Michael","Snow, Bradford","Matsoukas, Spyros"],"emails":["kollart@amazon.com","danijean@amazon.com","lsstuar@amazon.com","karowc@amazon.com","tagyoung@amazon.com","mathiasl@amazon.com","mikayser@amazon.com","brsnow@amazon.com","matsouka@amazon.com"],"author_id":["thomas-kollar","danielle-berry","lauren-stuart","karolina-owczarzak","tagyoung-chung","lambert-mathias","michael-kayser","bradford-snow","spyros-matsoukas"],"abstract":"This paper introduces a meaning representation for spoken language understanding. The Alexa meaning representation language (AMRL), unlike previous approaches, which factor spoken utterances into domains, provides a common representation for how people communicate in spoken language. AMRL is a rooted graph, links to a large-scale ontology, supports cross-domain queries, fine-grained types, complex utterances and composition. A spoken language dataset has been collected for Alexa, which contains \u223c20k examples across eight domains. A version of this meaning representation was released to developers at a trade show in 2016.","pages":"177--184","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N18-3022","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N18-3022","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans - Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 3 (Industry Papers)"},{"id":"N18-3023","title":"Practical Application of Domain Dependent Confidence Measurement for Spoken Language Understanding Systems","authors":["Mehrabani, Mahnoosh","Thomson, David","Stern, Benjamin"],"emails":["mahnoosh@interactions.com","","bstern@interactions.com"],"author_id":["mahnoosh-mehrabani","david-thomson","benjamin-stern"],"abstract":"Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), which extracts semantic information from speech, is not flawless, specially in practical applications. The reliability of the output of an SLU system can be evaluated using a semantic confidence measure. Confidence measures are a solution to improve the quality of spoken dialogue systems, by rejecting low-confidence SLU results. In this study we discuss real-world applications of confidence scoring in a customer service scenario. We build confidence models for three major types of dialogue states that are considered as different domains: how may I help you, number capture, and confirmation. Practical challenges to train domain-dependent confidence models, including data limitations, are discussed, and it is shown that feature engineering plays an important role to improve performance. We explore a wide variety of predictor features based on speech recognition, intent classification, and high-level domain knowledge, and find the combined feature set with the best rejection performance for each application.","pages":"185--192","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N18-3023","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N18-3023","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans - Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 3 (Industry Papers)"},{"id":"N18-3024","title":"Prediction for the Newsroom: Which Articles Will Get the Most Comments?","authors":["Ambroselli, Carl","Risch, Julian","Krestel, Ralf","Loos, Andreas"],"emails":["1carl.ambroselli@student.hpi.de","julian.risch@hpi.de","ralf.krestel@hpi.de","2andreas.loos@zeit.de"],"author_id":["carl-ambroselli","julian-risch","ralf-krestel","andreas-loos"],"abstract":"The overwhelming success of the Web and mobile technologies has enabled millions to share their opinions publicly at any time.

We propose to support manual moderation by proactively drawing the attention of our moderators to article discussions that most likely need their intervention. To this end, we predict which articles will receive a high number of comments. In contrast to existing work, we enrich the article with metadata, extract semantic and linguistic features, and exploit annotated data from a foreign language corpus.

Defining an entity by its classes, we employ usage data to predict the distribution over relations for that entity. For example, instances of person in a knowledge base may require a birth date, name and nationality to be considered complete. These predicted relation distributions enable detection of important gaps in the knowledge base, and define the required facts for unseen entities. Such characterisation of the knowledge base can also quantify how usage and completeness change over time. We demonstrate a method to measure Demand-Weighted Completeness, and show that a simple neural network model performs well at this prediction task.","pages":"200--207","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N18-3025","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N18-3025","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans - Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 3 (Industry Papers)"},{"id":"N18-3026","title":"Personalized neural language models for real-world query auto completion","authors":["Fiorini, Nicolas","Lu, Zhiyong"],"emails":["nicolas.fiorini@nih.gov","zhiyong.lu@nih.gov"],"author_id":["nicolas-fiorini","zhiyong-lu"],"abstract":"Query auto completion (QAC) systems are a standard part of search engines in industry, helping users formulate their query. Such systems update their suggestions after the user types each character, predicting the user{'}s intent using various signals {--} one of the most common being popularity. Recently, deep learning approaches have been proposed for the QAC task, to specifically address the main limitation of previous popularity-based methods: the inability to predict unseen queries. In this work we improve previous methods based on neural language modeling, with the goal of building an end-to-end system. We particularly focus on using real-world data by integrating user information for personalized suggestions when possible. We also make use of time information and study how to increase diversity in the suggestions while studying the impact on scalability.

In this work, we research the usage of dense vector representations to enhance a large-scale job recommendation system and to rank German job advertisements regarding their similarity. We follow a two-folded evaluation scheme: (1) we exploit historic user interactions to automatically create a dataset of similar jobs that enables an offline evaluation. (2) In addition, we conduct an online A\/B test and evaluate the best performing method on our platform reaching more than 1 million users. We achieve the best results by combining job titles with full-text job descriptions. In particular, this method builds dense document representation using words of the titles to weigh the importance of words of the full-text description.
