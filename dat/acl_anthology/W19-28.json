It is therefore important that coreference resolution systems are able to link these different types of mentions to the correct entity name. We evaluate state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems for the task of resolving all mentions to named entities. Our analysis reveals that standard coreference metrics do not reflect adequately the requirements in this task: they do not penalize systems for not identifying any mentions by name to an entity and they reward systems even if systems find correctly mentions to the same entity but fail to link these to a proper name (she{--}the student{--}no name). We introduce new metrics for evaluating named entity coreference that address these discrepancies and show that for the comparisons of competitive systems, standard coreference evaluations could give misleading results for this task. We are, however, able to confirm that the state-of-the art system according to traditional evaluations also performs vastly better than other systems on the named entity coreference task.","pages":"1--7","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-2801","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-2801","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, USA","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Computational Models of Reference, Anaphora and Coreference"},{"id":"W19-2802","title":"Neural Coreference Resolution with Limited Lexical Context and Explicit Mention Detection for Oral {F}rench","authors":["Grobol, Lo{\\\"\\i}c"],"emails":["loic.grobol@inria.fr"],"author_id":["loic-grobol"],"abstract":"We propose an end-to-end coreference resolution system obtained by adapting neural models that have recently improved the state-of-the-art on the OntoNotes benchmark to make them applicable to other paradigms for this task.

We independently replicate two existing models in a controlled setup, introduce a simplified variant of one of the models and analyze their performance in direct comparison. Our results suggest that today{'}s models are limited as several stochastic variables make learning difficult. We show that the most challenging point in the systems is the decision if the next token is an entity token. The low precision and recall for this variable will lead to severe cascading errors. Our own simplified approach dispenses with the need for latent variables and improves the performance in the entity yes\/no decision.

This task has been largely neglected by the EDL community because it is challenging to outperform simple edit distance or other heuristics based baselines. We propose a novel approach based on encoding the orthographic similarity of the mentions using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. Our model adapts a training procedure from the one-shot facial recognition literature in order to achieve this. We also perform several exploratory probing tasks on our name encodings in order to determine what specific types of information are likely to be encoded by our model. Experiments show our approach provides up to a 6.6{\\%} absolute CEAFm F-Score improvement over state-of-the-art methods and successfully captures phonological relations across languages.","pages":"20--25","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-2804","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-2804","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, USA","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Computational Models of Reference, Anaphora and Coreference"},{"id":"W19-2805","title":"Cross-lingual Incongruences in the Annotation of Coreference","authors":["Lapshinova-Koltunski, Ekaterina","Lo{\\'a}iciga, Sharid","Hardmeier, Christian","Krielke, Pauline"],"emails":["e.lapshinova@mx.uni-saarland.de","sharid.loaiciga@gu.se","christian.hardmeier@lingfil.uu.se","pauline.krielke@uni-saarland.de"],"author_id":["ekaterina-lapshinova-koltunski","sharid-loaiciga","christian-hardmeier","pauline-krielke"],"abstract":"In the present paper, we deal with incongruences in English-German multilingual coreference annotation and present automated methods to discover them.

Next, a cross-lingual coreference resolution system is designed. With this approach, the system learns from a bigger English corpus, using cross-lingual embeddings, to perform the coreference resolution for Basque. The cross-lingual system obtains slightly better results (40.93 F1 CoNLL) than the monolingual system (39.12 F1 CoNLL), without using any Basque language corpus to train it.","pages":"35--41","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-2806","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-2806","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, USA","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Computational Models of Reference, Anaphora and Coreference"}]
