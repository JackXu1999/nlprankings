We find that some domains are definitely more prone to gender bias than others, and that the categories of gender bias present also vary for each set of word embeddings. We detect some gender bias in GAP. We also propose a simple but novel method for discovering new bias categories by clustering word embeddings.

We focus on Arabic, a gender-marking morphologically rich language, in the context of machine translation (MT) from English, and for first-person-singular constructions only. Our contributions are the development of a system-independent gender-awareness wrapper, and the building of a corpus for training and evaluating first-person-singular gender identification and reinflection in Arabic. Our results successfully demonstrate the viability of this approach with 8{\\%} relative increase in Bleu score for first-person-singular feminine, and 5.3{\\%} comparable increase for first-person-singular masculine on top of a state-of-the-art gender-blind MT system on a held-out test set.","pages":"155--165","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-3822","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-3822","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"W19-3823","title":"Measuring Bias in Contextualized Word Representations","authors":["Kurita, Keita","Vyas, Nidhi","Pareek, Ayush","Black, Alan W","Tsvetkov, Yulia"],"emails":["kkurita@andrew.cmu.edu","nkvyas@andrew.cmu.edu","apareek@andrew.cmu.edu","awb@andrew.cmu.edu","ytsvetko@andrew.cmu.edu"],"author_id":["keita-kurita","nidhi-vyas","ayush-pareek","alan-w-black","yulia-tsvetkov"],"abstract":"Contextual word embeddings such as BERT have achieved state of the art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Since they are optimized to capture the statistical properties of training data, they tend to pick up on and amplify social stereotypes present in the data as well. In this study, we (1) propose a template-based method to quantify bias in BERT; (2) show that this method obtains more consistent results in capturing social biases than the traditional cosine based method; and (3) conduct a case study, evaluating gender bias in a downstream task of Gender Pronoun Resolution. Although our case study focuses on gender bias, the proposed technique is generalizable to unveiling other biases, including in multiclass settings, such as racial and religious biases.","pages":"166--172","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-3823","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-3823","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"W19-3824","title":"On Measuring Gender Bias in Translation of Gender-neutral Pronouns","authors":["Cho, Won Ik","Kim, Ji Won","Kim, Seok Min","Kim, Nam Soo"],"emails":["wicho@hi.snu.ac.kr","smkim@hi.snu.ac.kr","nkim@snu.ac.kr","kimjiwon08@snu.ac.kr"],"author_id":["won-ik-cho","ji-won-kim","nam-soo-kim","seok-min-kim"],"abstract":"Ethics regarding social bias has recently thrown striking issues in natural language processing. Especially for gender-related topics, the need for a system that reduces the model bias has grown in areas such as image captioning, content recommendation, and automated employment. However, detection and evaluation of gender bias in the machine translation systems are not yet thoroughly investigated, for the task being cross-lingual and challenging to define. In this paper, we propose a scheme for making up a test set that evaluates the gender bias in a machine translation system, with Korean, a language with gender-neutral pronouns. Three word\/phrase sets are primarily constructed, each incorporating positive\/negative expressions or occupations; all the terms are gender-independent or at least not biased to one side severely. Then, additional sentence lists are constructed concerning formality of the pronouns and politeness of the sentences. With the generated sentence set of size 4,236 in total, we evaluate gender bias in conventional machine translation systems utilizing the proposed measure, which is termed here as translation gender bias index (TGBI). The corpus and the code for evaluation is available on-line.","pages":"173--181","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-3824","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-3824","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing"}]
