The L2TOR ITS is developed for the purpose of investigating the efficacy of robot-assisted second language tutoring in early childhood. We explain the process of generating contextually-relevant utterances, such as task-specific feedback messages, and discuss challenges regarding multimodality and multilingualism for situated natural language generation from a robot tutoring perspective.",

    abstract = "One of the most natural ways for human robot communication is through spoken language. Training human-robot interaction systems require access to large datasets which are expensive to obtain and labour intensive. In this paper, we describe an approach for learning from minimal data, using as a toy example language understanding in spoken dialogue systems. Understanding of spoken language is crucial because it has implications for natural language generation, i.e. correctly understanding a user{'}s utterance will lead to choosing the right response/action. Finally, we discuss implications for Natural Language Generation in Human-Robot Interaction.",

For social robots, humor is one aspect to make interactions more natural, enjoyable, and to increase credibility and acceptance. In combination with appropriate non-verbal behavior, natural language generation offers the ability to create content on-the-fly. This work outlines the building-blocks for providing an individual, multimodal interaction experience by shaping the robot{'}s humor with the help of Natural Language Generation and Reinforcement Learning based on human social signals.",

We argue that existing modeling techniques are mostly tailored to textual data and are not sufficient to make NLG technology meet the requirements of agents which target fluid interaction and collaboration in the real world. We revisit interactive instruction giving as a challenge for datadriven NLG and, based on insights from previous GIVE challenges, propose that instruction giving should be addressed in a setting that involves visual grounding and spoken language. These basic design decisions will require NLG frameworks that are capable of monitoring their environment as well as timing and revising their verbal output. We believe that these are core capabilities for making NLG technology transferrable to interactive systems.",
