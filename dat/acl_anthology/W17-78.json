Although the data sets are different in their content and in the structuring of data, they contain similar common {``}entities{''} such as names of persons. Here we describe the semantic enrichment process of how these data sets can be inter-linked through URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) taking person names as a concrete example. Moreover, we also point to societal benefits of applying such semantic enrichment methods in order to open and connect our resources to various services.","pages":"1--8","doi":"10.26615\/978-954-452-040-3_001","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.26615\/978-954-452-040-3_001","publisher":"INCOMA Inc.","address":"Varna","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop Knowledge Resources for the Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities associated with {RANLP} 2017"},{"id":"W17-7802","title":"A Multiform Balanced Dependency Treebank for {R}omanian","authors":["Colhon, Mihaela","M{\\u{a}}r{\\u{a}}nduc, C{\\u{a}}t{\\u{a}}lina","Mititelu, C{\\u{a}}t{\\u{a}}lin"],"emails":["mcolhon@gmail.com","catalinamaranduc@gmail.com","catalinmititelu@yahoo.com"],"author_id":["mihaela-colhon","catalina-maranduc","catalin-mititelu"],"abstract":"The UAIC-RoDia-DepTb is a balanced treebank, containing texts in non-standard language: 2,575 chats sentences, old Romanian texts (a Gospel printed in 1648, a codex of laws printed in 1818, a novel written in 1910), regional popular poetry, legal texts, Romanian and foreign fiction, quotations. The proportions are comparable; each of these types of texts is represented by subsets of at least 1,000 phrases, so that the parser can be trained on their peculiarities. The annotation of the treebank started in 2007, and it has classical tags, such as those in school grammar, with the intention of using the resource for didactic purposes. The classification of circumstantial modifiers is rich in semantic information. We present in this paper the development in progress of this resource which has been automatically annotated and entirely manually corrected. We try to add new texts, and to make it available in more formats, by keeping all the morphological and syntactic information annotated, and adding logical-semantic information. We will describe here two conversions, from the classic syntactic format into Universal Dependencies format and into a logical-semantic layer, which will be shortly presented.","pages":"9--18","doi":"10.26615\/978-954-452-040-3_002","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.26615\/978-954-452-040-3_002","publisher":"INCOMA Inc.","address":"Varna","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop Knowledge Resources for the Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities associated with {RANLP} 2017"},{"id":"W17-7803","title":"{GR}a{SP}: Grounded Representation and Source Perspective","authors":["Fokkens, Antske","Vossen, Piek","Rospocher, Marco","Hoekstra, Rinke","van Hage, Willem Robert"],"emails":["antske.fokkens@vu.nl","piek.vossen@vu.nl","rospocher@fbk.eu","r.hoekstra@elsevier.com","w.vanhage@esciencecenter.nl"],"author_id":["antske-fokkens","piek-vossen","marco-rospocher","rinke-hoekstra","willem-robert-van-hage"],"abstract":"When people or organizations provide information, they make choices regarding what information they include and how they present it.

Here we present a novel approach in which a machine learning algorithm is used to find dependencies in a table of parameters. The result is a dependency graph in which some of the parameters can be fully predicted from others. These empirical findings can be then subjected to linguistic analysis, which may either refute them by providing typological counter-examples of languages not included in the original dataset, dismiss them on theoretical grounds, or uphold them as tentative empirical laws worth of further study.","pages":"31--37","doi":"10.26615\/978-954-452-040-3_005","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.26615\/978-954-452-040-3_005","publisher":"INCOMA Inc.","address":"Varna","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop Knowledge Resources for the Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities associated with {RANLP} 2017"}]
