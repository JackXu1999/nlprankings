Consequently, many such units produce substantial gaps in systems intended to solve sophisticated computational linguistics tasks, such as parsing, deep semantic analysis, question answering, machine translation, or text generation. They also present obstacles for applying advanced techniques to these tasks, such as machine learning.

While grammaticalized alternations keep lexical meaning of verbs unchanged, they are usually characterized by various changes in their morphosyntactic structure. In this contribution, we demonstrate on the example of reciprocity and its representation in the valency lexicon of Czech verbs, VALLEX how a linguistic description of complex (and still systemic) changes characteristic of grammaticalized alternations can benefit from an integration of grammatical rules into a valency lexicon. In contrast to other types of grammaticalized alternations, reciprocity in Czech has received relatively little attention although it closely interacts with various linguistic phenomena (e.g., with light verbs, diatheses, and reflexivity).","pages":"18--27","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W16-3804","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Grammar and Lexicon: interactions and interfaces ({G}ram{L}ex)"},{"id":"W16-3805","title":"Extra-Specific Multiword Expressions for Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents","authors":["McShane, Marjorie","Nirenburg, Sergei"],"emails":["margemc34@gmail.com","zavedomo@gmail.com"],"author_id":["marjorie-mcshane","sergei-nirenburg"],"abstract":"Language-endowed intelligent agents benefit from leveraging lexical knowledge falling at different points along a spectrum of compositionality. This means that robust computational lexicons should include not only the compositional expectations of argument-taking words, but also non-compositional collocations (idioms), semi-compositional collocations that might be difficult for an agent to interpret (e.g., standard metaphors), and even collocations that could be compositionally analyzed but are so frequently encountered that recording their meaning increases the efficiency of interpretation. In this paper we argue that yet another type of string-to-meaning mapping can also be useful to intelligent agents: remembered semantic analyses of actual text inputs. These can be viewed as super-specific multi-word expressions whose recorded interpretations mimic a person{'}s memories of knowledge previously learned from language input. These differ from typical annotated corpora in two ways. First, they provide a full, context-sensitive semantic interpretation rather than select features. Second, they are are formulated in the ontologically-grounded metalanguage used in a particular agent environment, meaning that the interpretations contribute to the dynamically evolving cognitive capabilites of agents configured in that environment.","pages":"28--37","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W16-3805","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Grammar and Lexicon: interactions and interfaces ({G}ram{L}ex)"},{"id":"W16-3806","title":"Universal Dependencies: A Cross-Linguistic Perspective on Grammar and Lexicon","authors":["Nivre, Joakim"],"emails":["joakim.nivre@lingfil.uu.se"],"author_id":["joakim-nivre"],"abstract":"Universal Dependencies is an initiative to develop cross-linguistically consistent grammatical annotation for many languages, with the goal of facilitating multilingual parser development, cross-lingual learning and parsing research from a language typology perspective. It assumes a dependency-based approach to syntax and a lexicalist approach to morphology, which together entail that the fundamental units of grammatical annotation are words. Words have properties captured by morphological annotation and enter into relations captured by syntactic annotation. Moreover, priority is given to relations between lexical content words, as opposed to grammatical function words.

As regards the position of an argument in the dependency structure with respect to its predicate, there exist three types of valency filling: active (canonical), passive, and discontinuous. Of these, the first type is studied much better than the other two. As a rule, canonical actants are unambiguously marked in the syntactic structure, and each actant corresponds to a unique syntactic position. Linguistic information on which syntactic function an actant might have (subject, direct or indirect object), what its morphological form should be and which prepositions or conjunctions it requires, can be given in the lexicon in the form of government patterns, subcategorization frames, or similar data structures. We concentrate on non-canonical cases of valency filling in Russian, which are characteristic of non-verbal parts of speech, such as adverbs, adjectives, and particles, in the first place. They are more difficult to handle than canonical ones, because the position of the actant in the tree is governed by more complicated rules. A valency may be filled by expressions occupying different syntactic positions, and a syntactic position may accept expressions filling different valencies of the same word. We show how these phenomena can be processed in a semantic analyzer.","pages":"51--60","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W16-3808","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Grammar and Lexicon: interactions and interfaces ({G}ram{L}ex)"},{"id":"W16-3809","title":"Improvement of {V}erb{N}et-like resources by frame typing","authors":["Danlos, Laurence","Constant, Matthieu","Barque, Lucie"],"emails":["anlos@inria.fr","onstant@univ-lorraine.fr","arque@univ-paris13.fr"],"author_id":["laurence-danlos","matthieu-constant","lucie-barque"],"abstract":"Verbenet is a French lexicon developed by {``}translation{''} of its English counterpart {---} VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005){---}and treatment of the specificities of French syntax (Pradet et al., 2014; Danlos et al., 2016).

The motivation for the task is to extend a verbal valency (i.e., predicate-argument) lexicon by adding nouns that share the valency properties with the base verb, assuming their properties can be derived (even if not trivially) from the underlying verb by deterministic grammatical rules. At the same time, even in inflective languages, not all deverbatives are simply created from their underlying base verb by regular lexical derivation processes. We have thus developed hybrid techniques that use both large parallel corpora and several standard lexical resources. Thanks to the use of parallel corpora, the resulting sets contain also synonyms, which the lexical derivation rules cannot get. For evaluation, we have manually created a small, 100-verb gold data since no such dataset was initially available for Czech.","pages":"71--80","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W16-3810","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Grammar and Lexicon: interactions and interfaces ({G}ram{L}ex)"},{"id":"W16-3811","title":"The Grammar of {E}nglish Deverbal Compounds and their Meaning","authors":["Iord{\\u{a}}chioaia, Gianina","van der Plas, Lonneke","Jagfeld, Glorianna"],"emails":["gianina@ifla.uni-stuttgart.de","lonneke.vanderplas@um.edu.mt","glorianna.jagfeld@gmail.com"],"author_id":["gianina-iordachioaia","lonneke-van-der-plas","glorianna-jagfeld"],"abstract":"We present an interdisciplinary study on the interaction between the interpretation of noun-noun deverbal compounds (DCs; e.g., task assignment) and the morphosyntactic properties of their deverbal heads in English.

We start with Grimshaw{'}s (1990) insight that deverbal nouns are ambiguous between argument-supporting nominal (ASN) readings, which inherit verbal arguments (e.g., the assignment of the tasks), and the less verbal and more lexicalized Result Nominal and Simple Event readings (e.g., a two-page assignment). Following Grimshaw, our hypothesis is that the former will realize object arguments in DCs, while the latter will receive a wider range of interpretations like root compounds headed by non-derived nouns (e.g., chocolate box). Evidence from a large corpus assisted by machine learning techniques confirms this hypothesis, by showing that, besides other features, the realization of internal arguments by deverbal heads outside compounds (i.e., the most distinctive ASN-property in Grimshaw 1990) is a good predictor for an object interpretation of non-heads in DCs.","pages":"81--91","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W16-3811","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Grammar and Lexicon: interactions and interfaces ({G}ram{L}ex)"},{"id":"W16-3812","title":"Encoding a syntactic dictionary into a super granular unification grammar","authors":["Kahane, Sylvain","Lareau, Fran{\\c{c}}ois"],"emails":["sylvain@kahane.fr","francois.lareau@umontreal.ca"],"author_id":["sylvain-kahane","francois-lareau"],"abstract":"We show how to turn a large-scale syntactic dictionary into a dependency-based unification grammar where each piece of lexical information calls a separate rule, yielding a super granular grammar.
