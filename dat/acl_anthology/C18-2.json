However, abbreviations are not necessarily defined in documents that employ them. Understanding all abbreviations used in a given document often requires extensive knowledge of the target domain and the ability to disambiguate based on context. This creates considerable entry barriers to newcomers and difficulties in automated document processing. Existing abbreviation expansion systems or tools require substantial technical knowledge for set up or make strong assumptions which limit their use in practice. Here, we present Abbreviation Expander, a system that builds on state of the art methods for identification of abbreviations, acronyms and their definitions and a novel disambiguator for abbreviation expansion in an easily accessible web-based solution.","pages":"1--4","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-2001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations"},{"id":"C18-2002","title":"The {INCE}p{TION} Platform: Machine-Assisted and Knowledge-Oriented Interactive Annotation","authors":["Klie, Jan-Christoph","Bugert, Michael","Boullosa, Beto","Eckart de Castilho, Richard","Gurevych, Iryna"],"emails":["","","","",""],"author_id":["jan-christoph-klie","michael-bugert","beto-boullosa","richard-eckart-de-castilho","iryna-gurevych"],"abstract":"We introduce INCEpTION, a new annotation platform for tasks including interactive and semantic annotation (e.g., concept linking, fact linking, knowledge base population, semantic frame annotation).

In particular, we aim at visualizing the medical histories of patients. In medicine, choosing relevant reports from a patient{'}s past exams for comparison provide valuable information for precise treatment planning. Manually finding the relevant reports for comparison studies from a large database is time-consuming, which could result overlooking of some critical information. This task can be automated by defining similarity among documents which is a nontrivial task since these documents are often stored in an unstructured text format. To facilitate this, we have used a representation learning algorithm that creates a semantic representation space for documents where the clinically related documents lie close to each other. We have utilized referral information to weakly supervise a LSTM network to learn this semantic space. The abstract representations within this semantic space are not only useful to visualize disease progressions corresponding to the relevant report groups of a patient, but are also beneficial to analyze diseases at the population level. The proposed key tool here is clustering of documents based on the document similarity whose metric is learned from corpora.","pages":"30--33","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/C18-2007","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations"},{"id":"C18-2008","title":"{H}i{DE}: a Tool for Unrestricted Literature Based Discovery","authors":["Preiss, Judita","Stevenson, Mark"],"emails":["reiss@salford.ac.uk","tevenson@sheffield.ac.uk"],"author_id":["judita-preiss","mark-stevenson"],"abstract":"As the quantity of publications increases daily, researchers are forced to narrow their attention to their own specialism and are therefore less likely to make new connections with other areas.

To show that our approach is language-independent, we evaluate nnDDC using up to 40 different languages. We derive a topic model based on nnDDC, which generates probability distributions over semantic units for any input on sense-, word- and text-level. Unlike related approaches, however, these probabilities are estimated by means of nnDDC so that each dimension of the resulting vector representation is uniquely labeled by a DDC class.
