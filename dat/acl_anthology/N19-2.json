It is an indispensable service for billions of Asian users. Although the neural-based language model is extensively studied and shows promising results in sequence-to-sequence tasks, applying a neural-based language model to IME was not considered feasible due to high latency when converting words on user devices. In this work, we articulate the bottleneck of neural IME decoding to be the heavy softmax computation over a large vocabulary. We propose an approach that incrementally builds a subset vocabulary from the word lattice. Our approach always computes the probability with a selected subset vocabulary. When the selected vocabulary is updated, the stale probabilities in previous steps are fixed by recomputing the missing logits. The experiments on Japanese IME benchmark shows an over 50x speedup for the softmax computations comparing to the baseline, reaching real-time speed even on commodity CPU without losing conversion accuracy. The approach is potentially applicable to other incremental sequence-to-sequence decoding tasks such as real-time continuous speech recognition.","pages":"1--8","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-2001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-2001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis - Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Industry Papers)"},{"id":"N19-2002","title":"Locale-agnostic Universal Domain Classification Model in Spoken Language Understanding","authors":["Lee, Jihwan","Sarikaya, Ruhi","Kim, Young-Bum"],"emails":["jihwl@amazon.com","rsarikay@amazon.com","youngbum@amazon.com"],"author_id":["jihwan-lee","ruhi-sarikaya","young-bum-kim"],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an approach for leveraging available data across multiple locales sharing the same language to 1) improve domain classification model accuracy in Spoken Language Understanding and user experience even if new locales do not have sufficient data and 2) reduce the cost of scaling the domain classifier to a large number of locales.

One important approach to constructing a comprehensive knowledge base is to extract information from Wikipedia infobox tables to populate an existing KB. Despite previous successes in the Infobox Extraction (IBE) problem (e.g., DBpedia), three major challenges remain: 1) Deterministic extraction patterns used in DBpedia are vulnerable to template changes; 2) Over-trusting Wikipedia anchor links can lead to entity disambiguation errors; 3) Heuristic-based extraction of unlinkable entities yields low precision, hurting both accuracy and completeness of the final KB. This paper presents a robust approach that tackles all three challenges. We build probabilistic models to predict relations between entity mentions directly from the infobox tables in HTML. The entity mentions are linked to identifiers in an existing KB if possible. The unlinkable ones are also parsed and preserved in the final output.

Complex dialog management is required because our target domain is real world mixed initiative food ordering between agents and their customers, where individual customer utterances may contain multiple intents and refer to food items with complex structure. For example, a customer might say {``}Can I get a deluxe burger with large fries and oh put extra mayo on the burger would you?{''} We approach this task as a multi-level sequence labeling problem, with the constraint of limited real training data. Both traditional methods like HMM, MEMM, or CRF and newer methods like DNN or BiLSTM use only homogeneous feature sets. Newer methods perform better but also require considerably more data. Previous research has done pseudo-data synthesis to obtain the required amounts of training data. We propose to use a k-NN learner with heterogeneous feature set. We used windowed word n-grams, POS tag n-grams and pre-trained word embeddings as features. For the experiments we perform a comparison between using pseudo-data and real world data. We also perform semi-supervised self-training to obtain additional labeled data, in order to better model real world scenarios. Instead of using massive pseudo-data, we show that with only less than 1{\\%} of the data size, we can achieve better result than any of the methods above by annotating real world data. We achieve labeled bracketed F-scores of 75.46, 52.84 and 49.66 for the three levels of sequence labeling where each level has a longer word span than its previous level. Overall we achieve 60.71F. In comparison, two previous systems, MEMM and DNN-ELMO, achieved 52.32 and 45.25 respectively.","pages":"149--156","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-2019","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-2019","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis - Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Industry Papers)"},{"id":"N19-2020","title":"Train One Get One Free: Partially Supervised Neural Network for Bug Report Duplicate Detection and Clustering","authors":["Poddar, Lahari","Neves, Leonardo","Brendel, William","Marujo, Luis","Tulyakov, Sergey","Karuturi, Pradeep"],"emails":["lahari@comp.nus.edu.sg","lneves@snap.com","willb@snap.com","luis.marujo@snap.com","stulyakov@snap.com","pradeep.karuturi@snap.com"],"author_id":["lahari-poddar","leonardo-neves","william-brendel","luis-marujo","sergey-tulyakov","pradeep-karuturi"],"abstract":"Tracking user reported bugs requires considerable engineering effort in going through many repetitive reports and assigning them to the correct teams. This paper proposes a neural architecture that can jointly (1) detect if two bug reports are duplicates, and (2) aggregate them into latent topics. Leveraging the assumption that learning the topic of a bug is a sub-task for detecting duplicates, we design a loss function that can jointly perform both tasks but needs supervision for only duplicate classification, achieving topic clustering in an unsupervised fashion. We use a two-step attention module that uses self-attention for topic clustering and conditional attention for duplicate detection. We study the characteristics of two types of real world datasets that have been marked for duplicate bugs by engineers and by non-technical annotators. The results demonstrate that our model not only can outperform state-of-the-art methods for duplicate classification on both cases, but can also learn meaningful latent clusters without additional supervision.","pages":"157--165","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-2020","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-2020","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis - Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Industry Papers)"},{"id":"N19-2021","title":"Robust Semantic Parsing with Adversarial Learning for Domain Generalization","authors":["Marzinotto, Gabriel","Damnati, G{\\'e}raldine","B{\\'e}chet, Fr{\\'e}d{\\'e}ric","Favre, Beno{\\^\\i}t"],"emails":["gabriel.marzinotto@orange.com","geraldine.damnati@orange.com","frederic.bechet@lis-lab.fr","benoit.favre@lis-lab.fr"],"author_id":["gabriel-marzinotto","geraldine-damnati","frederic-bechet","benoit-favre"],"abstract":"This paper addresses the issue of generalization for Semantic Parsing in an adversarial framework. Building models that are more robust to inter-document variability is crucial for the integration of Semantic Parsing technologies in real applications. The underlying question throughout this study is whether adversarial learning can be used to train models on a higher level of abstraction in order to increase their robustness to lexical and stylistic variations. We propose to perform Semantic Parsing with a domain classification adversarial task, covering various use-cases with or without explicit knowledge of the domain. The strategy is first evaluated on a French corpus of encyclopedic documents, annotated with FrameNet, in an information retrieval perspective. This corpus constitutes a new public benchmark, gathering documents from various thematic domains and various sources. We show that adversarial learning yields improved results when using explicit domain classification as the adversarial task. We also propose an unsupervised domain discovery approach that yields equivalent improvements. The latter is also evaluated on a PropBank Semantic Role Labeling task on the CoNLL-2005 benchmark and is shown to increase the model{'}s generalization capabilities on out-of-domain data.","pages":"166--173","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-2021","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-2021","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis - Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Industry Papers)"},{"id":"N19-2022","title":"{TOI}-{CNN}: a Solution of Information Extraction on {C}hinese Insurance Policy","authors":["Sun, Lin","Zhang, Kai","Ji, Fule","Yang, Zhenhua"],"emails":["sunl@zucc.edu.cn","31601087@stu.zucc.edu.cn","31601102@stu.zucc.edu.cn","yangzhenhua@fc18.com.cn"],"author_id":["lin-sun","kai-zhang","fule-ji","zhenhua-yang"],"abstract":"Contract analysis can significantly ease the work for humans using AI techniques.

The application of NER in the context of audio de-identification has yet to be fully investigated. To this end, we define the task of audio de-ID, in which audio spans with entity mentions should be detected.
