Moreover, pseudo grammars increase the diversity of base models; therefore, together with all other models, further improve system combination. Based on automatic POS tagging, our final model achieves a UAS of 87.23{\\%}, resulting in a significant improvement of the state of the art.","pages":"301--314","doi":"10.1162\/tacl_a_00229","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/Q13-1025","year":"2013","volume":"1","journal":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"Q13-1026","title":"Parsing entire discourses as very long strings: Capturing topic continuity in grounded language learning","authors":["Luong, Minh-Thang","Frank, Michael C.","Johnson, Mark"],"emails":["lmthang@stanford.edu","mcfrank@stanford.edu",""],"author_id":["minh-thang-luong","michael-c-frank","mark-johnson"],"abstract":"Grounded language learning, the task of mapping from natural language to a representation of meaning, has attracted more and more interest in recent years. In most work on this topic, however, utterances in a conversation are treated independently and discourse structure information is largely ignored. In the context of language acquisition, this independence assumption discards cues that are important to the learner, e.g., the fact that consecutive utterances are likely to share the same referent (Frank et al., 2013). The current paper describes an approach to the problem of simultaneously modeling grounded language at the sentence and discourse levels. We combine ideas from parsing and grammar induction to produce a parser that can handle long input strings with thousands of tokens, creating parse trees that represent full discourses. By casting grounded language learning as a grammatical inference task, we use our parser to extend the work of Johnson et al. (2012), investigating the importance of discourse continuity in children{'}s language acquisition and its interaction with social cues. Our model boosts performance in a language acquisition task and yields good discourse segmentations compared with human annotators.","pages":"315--326","doi":"10.1162\/tacl_a_00230","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/Q13-1026","year":"2013","volume":"1","journal":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"Q13-1027","title":"Dynamically Shaping the Reordering Search Space of Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation","authors":["Bisazza, Arianna","Federico, Marcello"],"emails":["bisazza@fbk.eu","federico@fbk.eu"],"author_id":["arianna-bisazza","marcello-federico"],"abstract":"Defining the reordering search space is a crucial issue in phrase-based SMT between distant languages. In fact, the optimal trade-off between accuracy and complexity of decoding is nowadays reached by harshly limiting the input permutation space. We propose a method to dynamically shape such space and, thus, capture long-range word movements without hurting translation quality nor decoding time. The space defined by loose reordering constraints is dynamically pruned through a binary classifier that predicts whether a given input word should be translated right after another. The integration of this model into a phrase-based decoder improves a strong Arabic-English baseline already including state-of-the-art early distortion cost (Moore and Quirk, 2007) and hierarchical phrase orientation models (Galley and Manning, 2008). Significant improvements in the reordering of verbs are achieved by a system that is notably faster than the baseline, while bleu and meteor remain stable, or even increase, at a very high distortion limit.","pages":"327--340","doi":"10.1162\/tacl_a_00231","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/Q13-1027","year":"2013","volume":"1","journal":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"Q13-1028","title":"What Makes Writing Great?

One way to extend beyond words is to compare two tuples using a function that combines pairwise similarities between the component words in the tuples. A strength of this approach is that it works with both relational similarity (analogy) and compositional similarity (paraphrase). However, past work required hand-coding the combination function for different tasks. The main contribution of this paper is that combination functions are generated by supervised learning. We achieve state-of-the-art results in measuring relational similarity between word pairs (SAT analogies and SemEval 2012 Task 2) and measuring compositional similarity between noun-modifier phrases and unigrams (multiple-choice paraphrase questions).","pages":"353--366","doi":"10.1162\/tacl_a_00233","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/Q13-1029","year":"2013","volume":"1","journal":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"Q13-1030","title":"Modeling Missing Data in Distant Supervision for Information Extraction","authors":["Ritter, Alan","Zettlemoyer, Luke","{Mausam}","Etzioni, Oren"],"emails":["rittera@cs.cmu.edu","lsz@cs.washington.edu","mausam@cs.washington.edu","orene@vulcan.com"],"author_id":["alan-ritter","luke-zettlemoyer","mausam","oren-etzioni"],"abstract":"Distant supervision algorithms learn information extraction models given only large readily available databases and text collections. Most previous work has used heuristics for generating labeled data, for example assuming that facts not contained in the database are not mentioned in the text, and facts in the database must be mentioned at least once. In this paper, we propose a new latent-variable approach that models missing data. This provides a natural way to incorporate side information, for instance modeling the intuition that text will often mention rare entities which are likely to be missing in the database. Despite the added complexity introduced by reasoning about missing data, we demonstrate that a carefully designed local search approach to inference is very accurate and scales to large datasets. Experiments demonstrate improved performance for binary and unary relation extraction when compared to learning with heuristic labels, including on average a 27{\\%} increase in area under the precision recall curve in the binary case.","pages":"367--378","doi":"10.1162\/tacl_a_00234","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/Q13-1030","year":"2013","volume":"1","journal":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"Q13-1031","title":"Data-Driven Metaphor Recognition and Explanation","authors":["Li, Hongsong","Zhu, Kenny Q.","Wang, Haixun"],"emails":["hongsli@microsoft.com","kzhu@cs.sjtu.edu.cn","haixun@google.com"],"author_id":["hongsong-li","kenny-zhu","haixun-wang"],"abstract":"Recognizing metaphors and identifying the source-target mappings is an important task as metaphorical text poses a big challenge for machine reading.

This problem is aggravated by the fact that they are normally trained using oracles that are deterministic and incomplete in the sense that they assume a unique canonical path through the transition system and are only valid as long as the parser does not stray from this path. In this paper, we give a general characterization of oracles that are nondeterministic and complete, present a method for deriving such oracles for transition systems that satisfy a property we call arc decomposition, and instantiate this method for three well-known transition systems from the literature. We say that these oracles are dynamic, because they allow us to dynamically explore alternative and nonoptimal paths during training {---} in contrast to oracles that statically assume a unique optimal path. Experimental evaluation on a wide range of data sets clearly shows that using dynamic oracles to train greedy parsers gives substantial improvements in accuracy. Moreover, this improvement comes at no cost in terms of efficiency, unlike other techniques like beam search.","pages":"403--414","doi":"10.1162\/tacl_a_00237","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/Q13-1033","year":"2013","volume":"1","journal":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"Q13-1034","title":"Joint Morphological and Syntactic Analysis for Richly Inflected Languages","authors":["Bohnet, Bernd","Nivre, Joakim","Boguslavsky, Igor","Farkas, Rich{\\'a}rd","Ginter, Filip","Haji{\\v{c}}, Jan"],"emails":["","","","","",""],"author_id":["bernd-bohnet","joakim-nivre","igor-boguslavsky","richard-farkas","filip-ginter","jan-hajic"],"abstract":"Joint morphological and syntactic analysis has been proposed as a way of improving parsing accuracy for richly inflected languages.
