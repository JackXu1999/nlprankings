Especially simple measures of complexity (average sentence and word length) are prominent indicators of oral and literate discourse.

The systems were evaluated on a Myanmar-Rakhine parallel text corpus developed by us. In addition, two types of word segmentation schemes for word embeddings were studied: Word-BPE and Syllable-BPE segmentation. Our experimental results clearly show that the highest quality NMT and statistical machine translation (SMT) performances are obtained with Syllable-BPE segmentation for both types of translations. If we focus on NMT, we find that the transformer with Word-BPE segmentation outperforms CNN and RNN for both Myanmar-Rakhine and Rakhine-Myanmar translation. However, CNN with Syllable-BPE segmentation obtains a higher score than the RNN and transformer.",

In this paper, we address the problem of Part-of-Speech tagging (POS) in the context of linguistic code switching (CS). We explore leveraging multiple neural network architectures to measure the impact of different pre-trained embeddings methods on POS tagging CS data. We investigate the landscape in four CS language pairs, Spanish-English, Hindi-English, Modern Standard Arabic- Egyptian Arabic dialect (MSA-EGY), and Modern Standard Arabic- Levantine Arabic dialect (MSA-LEV). Our results show that multilingual embedding (e.g., MSA-EGY and MSA-LEV) helps closely related languages (EGY/LEV) but adds noise to the languages that are distant (SPA/HIN). Finally, we show that our proposed models outperform state-of-the-art CS taggers for MSA-EGY language pair.",

The first model used is the Char-CNN model that merges multiple convolutions computed with kernels of different sizes. The second model is the LSTM network which applies a global max pooling over the returned sequences over time. Both models pass the activation maps to two fully-connected layers. The final model is based on String Kernels, computed on character p-grams extracted from speech transcripts. The model combines two blended kernel functions, one is the presence bits kernel, and the other is the intersection kernel. The empirical results obtained in the shared task prove that the approach can achieve good results. The system proposed in this paper obtained the fourth place with a macro-F1 score of 62.55{\%}",

The DMT shared task included two separate tracks, one for the simplified Chinese script and one for the traditional Chinese script. We submitted three runs on both tracks of the DMT task as well as on the GDI task. We won the traditional Chinese track using Naive Bayes with language model adaptation, came second on GDI with an adaptive version of the HeLI 2.0 method, and third on the simplified Chinese track using again the adaptive Naive Bayes.",

The Cuneiform Language Identification task in VarDial 2019 addresses the problem of identifying seven languages and dialects written in cuneiform; Sumerian and six dialects of Akkadian language: Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian Peripheral, Standard Babylonian, Neo-Babylonian, Late Babylonian, and Neo-Assyrian. This paper describes the approaches taken by SharifCL team to this problem in VarDial 2019. The best result belongs to an ensemble of Support Vector Machines and a naive Bayes classifier, both working on character-level features, with macro-averaged F1-score of 72.10{\%}.",

Our system for GDI achieved third place out of 6 teams, with a macro averaged F-1 of 74.6{\%}. In CLI, the system should distinguish seven languages written in cuneiform script.

The task included two languages, Sumerian and Akkadian. The latter is divided into six dialects: Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian peripheral, Standard Babylonian, Neo Babylonian, Late Babylonian, and Neo Assyrian. We approach the task using a meta-classifier trained on various SVM models and we show the effectiveness of the system for this task. Our submission achieved 0.738 F1 score in discriminating between the seven languages and dialects and it was ranked fourth in the competition among eight teams.",

A traditional approach to this problem is to design dialect identification systems and dialect-specific machine translation systems. However, under the recent paradigm of neural machine translation, shared multi-dialectal systems have become a natural alternative. Here we explore under which conditions it is beneficial to perform dialect identification for Arabic neural machine translation versus using a general system for all dialects.",

We compare this scenario with the low-resource scenario, where we have access to a small amount of gold-standard POS training data. Our experiments focus on Ukrainian as a representative of under-resourced languages. Russian is highly related to Ukrainian, so we exploit gold-standard Russian POS tags. We consider four techniques to perform Ukrainian POS tagging: zero-shot tagging and cross-lingual annotation projection (for the zero-resource scenario), and compare these with self-training and multilingual learning (for the low-resource scenario). We find that cross-lingual annotation projection works particularly well in the zero-resource scenario.",
