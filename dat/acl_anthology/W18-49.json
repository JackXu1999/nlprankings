[{"id":"W18-4901","title":"Annotation Schemes for Surface Construction Labeling","authors":["Levin, Lori"],"emails":["lsl@cs.cmu.edu"],"author_id":["lori-levin"],"abstract":"In this talk I will describe the interaction of linguistics and language technologies in Surface Construction Labeling (SCL) from the perspective of corpus annotation tasks such as definiteness, modality, and causality. Linguistically, following Construction Grammar, SCL recognizes that meaning may be carried by morphemes, words, or arbitrary constellations of morpho-lexical elements. SCL is like Shallow Semantic Parsing in that it does not attempt a full compositional analysis of meaning, but rather identifies only the main elements of a semantic frame, where the frames may be invoked by constructions as well as lexical items. Computationally, SCL is different from tasks such as information extraction in that it deals only with meanings that are expressed in a conventional, grammaticalized way and does not address inferred meanings. I review the work of Dunietz (2018) on the labeling of causal frames including causal connectives and cause and effect arguments. I will describe how to design an annotation scheme for SCL, including isolating basic units of form and meaning and building a {``}constructicon{''}. I will conclude with remarks about the nature of universal categories and universal meaning representations in language technologies. This talk describes joint work with Jaime Carbonell, Jesse Dunietz, Nathan Schneider, and Miriam Petruck.","pages":"1","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-4901","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Linguistic Annotation, Multiword Expressions and Constructions ({LAW}-{MWE}-{C}x{G}-2018)"},{"id":"W18-4902","title":"From Lexical Functional Grammar to Enhanced Universal Dependencies","authors":["Przepi{\\'o}rkowski, Adam","Patejuk, Agnieszka"],"emails":["adamp@ipipan.waw.pl","aep@ipipan.waw.pl"],"author_id":["adam-przepiorkowski","agnieszka-patejuk"],"abstract":"This is a summary of an invited talk.","pages":"2--4","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-4902","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Linguistic Annotation, Multiword Expressions and Constructions ({LAW}-{MWE}-{C}x{G}-2018)"},{"id":"W18-4903","title":"Leaving no token behind: comprehensive (and delicious) annotation of {MWE}s and supersenses","authors":["Schneider, Nathan"],"emails":["nathan.schneider@georgetown.edu"],"author_id":["nathan-schneider"],"abstract":"I will describe an unorthodox approach to lexical semantic annotation that prioritizes corpus coverage, democratizing analysis of a wide range of expression types.

Bio: Nathan Schneider is an annotation schemer and computational modeler for natural language. As Assistant Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science at Georgetown University, he looks for synergies between practical language technologies and the scientific study of language. He specializes in broad-coverage semantic analysis: designing linguistic meaning representations, annotating them in corpora, and automating them with statistical natural language processing techniques. A central focus in this research is the nexus between grammar and lexicon as manifested in multiword expressions and adpositions\/case markers. He has inhabited UC Berkeley (BA in Computer Science and Linguistics), Carnegie Mellon University (Ph.D. in Language Technologies), and the University of Edinburgh (postdoc). Now a Hoya and leader of NERT, he continues to play with data and algorithms for linguistic meaning.","pages":"5","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-4903","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Linguistic Annotation, Multiword Expressions and Constructions ({LAW}-{MWE}-{C}x{G}-2018)"},{"id":"W18-4904","title":"Processing {MWE}s: Neurocognitive Bases of Verbal {MWE}s and Lexical Cohesiveness within {MWE}s","authors":["Bhattasali, Shohini","Fabre, Murielle","Hale, John"],"emails":["sb2295@cornell.edu","mf684@cornell.edu","jthale@cornell.edu"],"author_id":["shohini-bhattasali","murielle-fabre","john-hale"],"abstract":"Multiword expressions have posed a challenge in the past for computational linguistics since they comprise a heterogeneous family of word clusters and are difficult to detect in natural language data.

In this study, we developed and evaluated annotation and segmentation guidelines in reference to the topological field model for German.

In conclusion, our syntax-based segmentations reflect interactional properties that are intrinsic to the social interactions that participants are involved in.

Those two tools cooperate so that the words and multi-word expressions stored in Cradle are directly referred to by ChaKi in conducting corpus annotation, and the words and expressions annotated in ChaKi can be output as a list of lexical entities that are to be stored in Cradle.","pages":"201--206","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-4922","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Linguistic Annotation, Multiword Expressions and Constructions ({LAW}-{MWE}-{C}x{G}-2018)"},{"id":"W18-4923","title":"{``}Fingers in the Nose{''}: Evaluating Speakers{'} Identification of Multi-Word Expressions Using a Slightly Gamified Crowdsourcing Platform","authors":["Fort, Kar{\\\"e}n","Guillaume, Bruno","Constant, Matthieu","Lef{\\`e}bvre, Nicolas","Pilatte, Yann-Alan"],"emails":["karen.fort@sorbonne-universite.fr","bruno.guillaume@inria.fr","onstant@univ-lorraine.fr","nicolas.lefebvre@inria.fr","yann-alan.pilatte@etu.sorbonne-universite.fr"],"author_id":["karen-fort","bruno-guillaume","matthieu-constant","nicolas-lefebvre","yann-alan-pilatte"],"abstract":"This article presents the results we obtained in crowdsourcing French speakers{'} intuition concerning multi-work expressions (MWEs).

In this paper, we compare two synthetic low-cost question treebank creation methods with a conventional manual high-cost annotation method in the context of three domains (news questions, political talk shows, and chatbots) for Modern Standard Arabic, a language with relatively low resources and rich morphology. Our results show that synthetic methods can be effective at significantly reducing parsing errors for a target domain without having to invest large resources on manual annotation; and the combination of manual and synthetic methods is our best domain-independent performer.","pages":"214--221","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-4924","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","year":"2018","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Linguistic Annotation, Multiword Expressions and Constructions ({LAW}-{MWE}-{C}x{G}-2018)"},{"id":"W18-4925","title":"Edition 1.1 of the {PARSEME} Shared Task on Automatic Identification of Verbal Multiword Expressions","authors":["Ramisch, Carlos","Cordeiro, Silvio Ricardo","Savary, Agata","Vincze, Veronika","Barbu Mititelu, Verginica","Bhatia, Archna","Buljan, Maja","Candito, Marie","Gantar, Polona","Giouli, Voula","G{\\\"u}ng{\\\"o}r, Tunga","Hawwari, Abdelati","I{\\~n}urrieta, Uxoa","Kovalevskait{\\.e}, Jolanta","Krek, Simon","Lichte, Timm","Liebeskind, Chaya","Monti, Johanna","Parra Escart{\\'\\i}n, Carla","QasemiZadeh, Behrang","Ramisch, Renata","Schneider, Nathan","Stoyanova, Ivelina","Vaidya, Ashwini","Walsh, Abigail"],"emails":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"author_id":["carlos-ramisch","silvio-cordeiro","agata-savary","veronika-vincze","verginica-barbu-mititelu","archna-bhatia","maja-buljan","marie-candito","polona-gantar","voula-giouli","tunga-gungor","abdelati-hawwari","uxoa-inurrieta","jolanta-kovalevskaite","simon-krek","timm-lichte","chaya-liebeskind","johanna-monti","carla-parra-escartin","behrang-qasemizadeh","renata-ramisch","nathan-schneider","ivelina-stoyanova","ashwini-vaidya","abigail-walsh"],"abstract":"This paper describes the PARSEME Shared Task 1.1 on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions.
